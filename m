Makes sense.

I'm not sure, but it might be a good idea to add something like this at the
end of 2.:
"(Most other APIs that check one of the caller's UIDs use the effective one.
This API uses the real UID instead for historical reasons.)"

In my opinion, it is inconsistent to use the real UID/GID here, the
effective one would be more appropriate. But since the existing code uses
the real UID/GID and that's not a security issue for existing users of
the ptrace API, this wasn't changed when I added the REALCREDS/FSCREDS
distinction.

I think that for a reader, it might help to point out that in most cases,
when a process is the subject in an access check, its effective UID/GID
are used, and this is (together with kill()) an exception to that rule.
But you're the expert on writing documentation, if you think that that's
too much detail / confusing here, it probably is.

Sounds good to me.
