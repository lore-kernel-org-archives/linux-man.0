I am not sure this is really feasible. It is not only a simple alignment
thing. Look at ppc for example (slice_get_unmapped_area). Other
architectures might have even more complicated rules e.g. arm and its
cache_is_vipt_aliasing. Also this applies only on MAP_SHARED || file
backed mappings.

I would really leave dogs sleeping... Trying to document all this in the
man page has chances to confuse more people than it has chances to help
those who already know all these nasty details.
