Adding Oleg just because he seems to do most of the ptrace related
maintenance these days.

         AKA don't let the audit subsystem know.  Which tends to
         generate audit records capable is called.

This test only exsits because the LSMs historically and I suspect
continue to be broken and deny a process the ability to ptrace itself.

Hmm.

When I gave this level of detail about the user namespace permission
checks you gave me some flack, because it was not particularly
comprehensible to the end users.  I think you deserve the same feedback=
=2E

How do we say this in a way that does not describes a useful way to
think about it.  I read this and I know a lot of what is going on and m=
y
mind goes numb.

How about something like this:

   If the callers uid and gid are the same as a processes uids and gids
   and the processes is configured to allow core dumps (aka it was neve=
r
   setuid or setgid) then the caller is allowed to ptrace a process.
  =20
   Otherwise the caller must have CAP_SYS_PTRACE.
  =20
   Linux security modules impose additional restrictions.
  =20
   For consistency access to various process attributes are guarded wit=
h
   the same security checks as the ptrace system call itself.  As they =
are
   all methods to get information about a process.

We certainly need something that gives a high level view so people
reading the man page can know what to expect.   If you get down into th=
e
weeds we run the danger of people beginning to think they can depend
upon bugs in the implementation.
