This looks wrong.

Looking at "[PATCH 05/18] Add io_uring IO interface", as far as I can
tell, io_ring_submit() is called via __io_uring_enter() <-
sys_io_uring_enter() with an unchecked argument "unsigned int
to_submit" that is then, in this patch, stored in state->ios_left and
then used here. On a 32-bit platform, file->f_count is only 32 bits
wide, so I think you can then trivially overflow the reference count,
leading to use-after-free. Am I missing something?
