I agree; the inconsistency is strange.  Probably it was a historical accident.

A little history, as it appears to me...

It looks like the Linux man page came from BSD.  The 4.3BSD man page
documented the type as "int" (and did not document an EINVAL error for
a negative bufsize), and even today the FreeBSD (6.2) man page
documents the type as "int" (and still does not document an EINVAL
error for this case), and that is how the argument is prototyped in
FreeBSD 6.2's <unistd.h>.  (I haven't tested what FreeBSD actually
does with a negative bufsize value.)

In 1993, when Linux man-pages-1.0 took the page from BSD (that page
was timestamped 19991), it looks like someone must have changed the
type of bufsize to "size_t" in the man page SYNOPSIS.  Now that could
be to match Linux libc of the time, which was already using "size_t"
(even though the then current kernel used "int"), or it could have
been to match the current standards (SUSv1, which was based on the
original POSIX.1, documents the type as "size"t").

The EINVAL error was added to man-pages-1.18 in 1997 (even though, as
you note, the type was "size_t").  I suspect (this was well before I
had any association with man-pages) that was done to reflect kernel
reality (since one could bypass glibc invoke the syscall directly),
but obviously it is inconsistent with the prototype.

(See above -- the type might have been taken either from POSIX.1 or
glibc, and that might have been quite deliberate.)

Probably done to match sys_readlink().

Your proposed kernel patch is an ABI change, albeit one that quite
likely would affect no applications.  So it might not hurt any one.
On the other hand, is there a benefit to making the change?

Perhaps the best think to do is simply to add a note to the man page
about this inconsistency.  (It's not sufficient to just remove the
EINVAL error as you propose in one of your patches, since that can
still occur when bypassing glibc.)

Perhaps others have some thoughts?

Cheers,

Michael
