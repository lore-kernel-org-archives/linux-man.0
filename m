Phillip, thanks for a good patch that sums things up. I didn't follow
up an earlier patch from Greg Smith, but that patch failed to explain t=
he
behavior we discussed in https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3D=
54271
where call did sometimes block for a considerable time.

I've applied the patch. Thanks for your efforts and persistence.

I've tweaked your text a bit to make some details clearer (I hope):

       readahead()  initiates  readahead  on a file so that subsequent
       reads from that file will, be satisfied from the cache, and not
       block  on  disk I/O (assuming the readahead was initiated early
       enough and that other activity on the system  did  not  in  the
       meantime flush pages from the cache).

       ...

       readahead()  attempts  to  schedule the reads in the background
       and return immediately.  However, it may block while  it  reads
       the  filesystem metadata needed to locate the requested blocks.
       This occurs frequently with ext[234] on large files using indi=E2=
=80=90
       rect  blocks instead of extents, giving the appearence that the
       call blocks until the requested data has been read.

Okay?

Cheers,

Michael
