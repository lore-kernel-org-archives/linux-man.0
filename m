I'm on board with this, but I think you need to also clarify what exactly
the fd stands for.  I think that (a) userspace should not have to care
about the struct pid implementation, and so (b) the procfd should stand
for all the pids.  So when taskfd_send_signal(fd, SIGSTOP, NULL, TASKFD_PGID)
becomes implemented, then open(/proc/5) will pin all three pids, as will
open(/proc/5/task/6).
