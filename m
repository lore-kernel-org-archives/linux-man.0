Wow Thomas, I planned to do exactly this and you beat me to it. Again.
Thanks for getting this started.

Michael, I imagine you want something more condensed, and I'll add to what
tglx posted (inline below) to try and get you that, but if you have
questions and need to fill in the gap, the paper I presented at RTLWS11 in
'09 covers this particularly nasty OPCODE in detail:

http://lwn.net/images/conf/rtlws11/papers/proc/p10.pdf

I believe Michael is looking for some higher level documentation, like how
to use these and what they are intended for. Probably something more like
Ulrich's Futexes are Tricky paper - but let's start with getting the op
codes, arguments, and return codes fleshed out.



For all the PI opcodes, we should probably mention something about the
futex value scheme (TID), whereas the other opcodes do not require any
specific value scheme.

No Owner:	0
Owner:		TID
Waiters:	TID | FUTEX_WAITERS

This is the relevant section from the referenced paper:


	
		
		
	
	
		
			
				
					The PI futex operations diverge from the oth-
ers in that they impose a policy describing how
the futex value is to be used. If the lock is un-
owned, the futex value shall be 0. If owned, it
shall be the thread id (tid) of the owning thread.
If there are threads contending for the lock, then
the FUTEX_WAITERS flag is set. With this policy in
place, userspace can atomically acquire an unowned
lock or release an uncontended lock using an atomic
instruction and their own tid. A non-zero futex
value will force waiters into the kernel to lock. The
FUTEX_WAITERS flag forces the owner into the kernel
to unlock. If the callers are forced into the kernel,
they then deal directly with an underlying rt_mutex
which implements the priority inheritance semantics.
After the rt_mutex is acquired, the futex value is up-
dated accordingly, before the calling thread returns
to userspace.

				
			
		
	
It is important to note that the kernel will update the futex value prior
to returning to userspace. Unlike other futex op codes,
FUTEX_CMP_REUQUE_PI (and FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI, FUTEX_LOCK_PI are designed
for the implementation of very specific IPC mechanisms).

Inner/outer terminology applies specifically to the glibc pthread
condition variable and mutex use case, but is overly specific for the man
page. Consider:

PI aware variant for FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE. Requeue tasks blocked on uaddr via
FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI from a non-PI source futex (uaddr) to a PI target
futex (uaddr2).

Because the point is to avoid the thundering herd in the first place, and
other nasty little races and faulting corner cases...

          val3 contains the expected value of uaddr (same as
FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE)

                   instead of FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI.

          [EINVAL] The kernel detected the FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI call is
                   attempting to requeue a task to a futex other than that
                   specified by the matching FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI call for
                   that task.

A number of these EINVALs can probably be combined into "Kernel detected
bad state" as far as the C library is concerned, but we can consolidate
later. But basically, EINVAL is returned if the non-pi to pi or op pairing
semantics are violated.

Bitset doesn't apply to FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI.

          [EINVAL] nr_wake != 1


EAGAIN == EWOULDBLOCK. We use each in the kernel, but will just refer to
them here as EAGAIN.

Hrm, I'm missing ESRCH and EPERM in my state diagrams.... put yes, we can
get ESRCH when looking up PI state, and we can return that from
futex_requeue.... That needs some time to review...

I'm not seeing the EPERM path, where is that coming from?

Return value >= 0 is successful, indicating the number of of tasks
requeued or woken (3 requeued and 1 woken would return 4).
