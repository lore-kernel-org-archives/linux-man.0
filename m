Ok, I finally have access to source code again. Scratch what I said above!
I looked at the code and tested it. If the process has exited but not
yet waited upon aka is a zombie procfd_send_signal() will return 0. This
is identical to kill(2) behavior. It should've been sort-of obvious
since when a process is in zombie state /proc/<pid> will still be around
which means that struct pid must still be around.
