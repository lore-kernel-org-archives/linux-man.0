Hello, Michael.

You're right, I'm probably confused with an earlier variant.  I might
still be forgetting something in this area.  I'll ping back if I can
recall something.

Currently, thread mode implementation doesn't allow reverting back to
domain.  The problem there is that it's impossible to tell which
portions of the domain consumptions that are accounted to the threaded
domain (the parent of threaded subtree) belong to the cgroup which is
trying to revert to domain.

But assuming we in the future allow reverting back to domain,
scenarios similar to what you suggested can become problematic.  All
operations always behaving recursively will probably be the only sane
solution but that blocks some possibilities for future changes.

Thanks.
