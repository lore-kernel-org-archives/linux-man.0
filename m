cc Tejun

cgroup.threads is not listed because it's not delegatable (doesn't have
CFTYPE_NS_DELEGATABLE flag set). I don't know if it was intended or just
an accident (I believe the latter).

PS In the latter case the following patch should fix it:

Subject: [PATCH] cgroup: make cgroup.threads delegatable

Make cgroup.threads file delegatable.
The behavior of cgroup.threads should follow the behavior of cgroup.procs.
