Yep, I can do that, and I'll also integrate all of your comments,
although I won't respond to all of them individually, I will integrate them.

This is one of the attributes of the hardware that I carried up in to
the interfaces.  The hardware contains two bits: one to write-disable
and one to access-disable.  You're allowed to set both at the same time,
even though the "access" bit overrules the "write" bit when set.

So, it doesn't make a ton of logical sense with these two flags, but it
might if we ever got an "execute disable" feature or some other feature
that could be combined more arbitrarily.
