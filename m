I dunno what user code cares about.  Linux's support for synchronous
exception handling is so far behind, say, Windows, that I don't know
if it's even used for anything very serious.  We should probably
profile it after I finish my changes and we can see how bad it is.  We
can't do anything at all about the time it takes the CPU to deliver
the exception, and trying to avoid IRET when we return would be tricky
at best, although siglongjmp() might end up skipping it.
