(namespaced) CAP_SYS_PTRACE is also sufficient here.


Both here and in the "admin-only attach" case, it is IMO important to
note that creating a user namespace effectively removes the Yama
protection because the owner of a namespace, when accessing its
contents from outside, is relatively capable.

This means that when a process tries to use namespaces to sandbox
itself, it inadvertently makes itself more accessible.

(This could probably be worked around in the kernel, but such a
workaround would likely not be default, but rather opt-in via a new
flag for clone() and unshare() or so.)
