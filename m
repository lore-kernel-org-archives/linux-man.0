No, definitely nothing with "kill" will be used because that's
absolutely not expressing what this syscall is doing.

I feel changing the name around by a single persons preferences is not
really a nice thing to do community-wise. So I'd like to hear other
people chime in first before I make that change.

Then this seems irrelevant to the current patch. It seems we can simply
switch to PIDTYPE_PGID once your new logic lands but not right now.
