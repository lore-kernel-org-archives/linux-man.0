It's a shame we are ending up with two "string configuration" ioctls.
PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_FILTER and this new one.  Though I guess
PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_FILTER is not really set up to be used generically.

But the core kernel is parsing "=" and "," in this case, so it's not 
entirely up to the PMU driver, right?

Is there going to be a list of allowed keywords somewhere, under /sys
or similar?

Well that's because this interface is a lot more complex than some of the 
other ioctls which just take a simple integer (or no argument at all).

The ftrace ioctl description could definitely use some expansion.

Then shouldn't this be set at perf_event_open() and not by an ioctl()?
