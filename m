But why do you care whether from_kgid and make_kgid will work?  If
they fail, then they fail.  I think that the point is that you're
checking whether allowing setgroups to drop groups is safe, and that's
only barely the same condition.

Do you mean before it's mapped?

That's what I think, too.

But why?  I don't see why this check is necessary or why it's relevant
to the current issue.

Fair enough.  Want to split that into a separate patch, then?
