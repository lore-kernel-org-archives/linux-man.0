Add documentation for eBPF helper functions to bpf.h user header file.
This documentation can be parsed with the Python script provided in
another commit of the patch series, in order to provide a RST document
that can later be converted into a man page.

The objective is to make the documentation easily understandable and
accessible to all eBPF developers, including beginners.

This patch contains descriptions for the following helper functions:

Helper from Kaixu:
- bpf_perf_event_read()

Helpers from Martin:
- bpf_skb_under_cgroup()
- bpf_xdp_adjust_head()

Helpers from Sargun:
- bpf_probe_write_user()
- bpf_current_task_under_cgroup()

Helper from Thomas:
- bpf_skb_change_head()

Helper from Gianluca:
- bpf_probe_read_str()

Helpers from Chenbo:
- bpf_get_socket_cookie()
- bpf_get_socket_uid()

v3:
- bpf_perf_event_read(): Fix time of selection for perf event type in
  description. Remove occurences of "cores" to avoid confusion with
  "CPU".

+ * 		Grows headroom of packet associated to *skb* and adjusts the
+ * 		offset of the MAC header accordingly, adding *len* bytes of
+ * 		space. It automatically extends and reallocates memory as
+ * 		required.
+ *
+ * 		This helper can be used on a layer 3 *skb* to push a MAC header
+ * 		for redirection into a layer 2 device.
+ *
+ * 		All values for *flags* are reserved for future usage, and must
+ * 		be left at zero.
+ *
+ * 		A call to this helper is susceptible to change data from the

+ * int bpf_probe_read_str(void *dst, int size, const void *unsafe_ptr)
+ * 	Description
+ * 		Copy a NUL terminated string from an unsafe address
+ * 		*unsafe_ptr* to *dst*. The *size* should include the
+ * 		terminating NUL byte. In case the string length is smaller than
+ * 		*size*, the target is not padded with further NUL bytes. If the
+ * 		string length is larger than *size*, just *size*-1 bytes are
+ * 		copied and the last byte is set to NUL.
+ *
+ * 		On success, the length of the copied string is returned. This
+ * 		makes this helper useful in tracing programs for reading
+ * 		strings, and more importantly to get its length at runtime. See
+ * 		the following snippet:
+ *
+ * 		::
+ *
+ * 			SEC("kprobe/sys_open")
+ * 			void bpf_sys_open(struct pt_regs *ctx)
+ * 			{
+ * 			        char buf[PATHLEN]; // PATHLEN is defined to 256
+ * 			        int res = bpf_probe_read_str(buf, sizeof(buf),
+ * 				                             ctx->di);
+ *
+ * 				// Consume buf, for example push it to
+ * 				// userspace via bpf_perf_event_output(); we
+ * 				// can use res (the string length) as event
+ * 				// size, after checking its boundaries.
+ * 			}
+ *
+ * 		In comparison, using **bpf_probe_read()** helper here instead
+ * 		to read the string would require to estimate the length at
+ * 		compile time, and would often result in copying more memory
+ * 		than necessary.
+ *
+ * 		Another useful use case is when parsing individual process
+ * 		arguments or individual environment variables navigating
+ * 		*current*\ **->mm->arg_start** and *current*\
+ * 		**->mm->env_start**: using this helper and the return value,
+ * 		one can quickly iterate at the right offset of the memory area.
+ * 	Return
+ * 		On success, the strictly positive length of the string,
+ * 		including the trailing NUL character. On error, a negative
+ * 		value.
+ *
+ * u64 bpf_get_socket_cookie(struct sk_buff *skb)
+ * 	Description
+ * 		Retrieve the socket cookie generated by the kernel from a
+ * 		**struct sk_buff** with a known socket. If none has been set
+ * 		yet, generate a new cookie. This helper can be useful for
+ * 		monitoring per socket networking traffic statistics as it
+ * 		provides a unique socket identifier per namespace.
+ * 	Return
+ * 		A 8-byte long non-decreasing number on success, or 0 if the
+ * 		socket field is missing inside *skb*.
+ *
+ * u32 bpf_get_socket_uid(struct sk_buff *skb)
+ * 	Return
+ * 		The owner UID of the socket associated to *skb*. If the socket
+ * 		is **NULL**, or if it is not a full socket (i.e. if it is a
+ * 		time-wait or a request socket instead), **overflowuid** value
+ * 		is returned (note that **overflowuid** might also be the actual
+ * 		UID value for the socket).
+ *
  * u32 bpf_set_hash(struct sk_buff *skb, u32 hash)
  * 	Description
  * 		Set the full hash for *skb* (set the field *skb*\ **->hash**)
