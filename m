Yes, you can argue that the bikeshed should be ioctl-colored and not
syscall-colored.

Yes, I have fixed bugs of this form.

The system call table is also extensible. ioctl is for when a given
piece of functionality *can't* realistically get its own system call
because it's separated from the main kernel somehow. procfs is a core
part of the kernel, so we can and should expose interfaces to it using
system calls.

These tools also care about ioctls. Adding a system call is a pain,
but the solution is to make adding system calls less of a pain, not to
permanently make the Linux ABI worse.
