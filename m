Eugene,

Thank you for updating this man page! I have a few edits and 
clarifications below.

I'd clarify that the keys "...are signed by a key in the builtin keyring" 
(not the keyring itself).

For builtin_and_secondary_trusted, keys can be linked from either 
.secondary_trusted_keys or .builtin_trusted. While it's true that 
.secondary_trusted_keys contains a link to the .builtin_trusted, making 
the secondary ring implicitly contain all the builtin keys, that would not 
be obvious to most readers.

As with builtin_trusted, it's one of the linked keys that would verify the 
signature.

The syntax is either "key_or_keyring:key" or "key_or_keyring:key:chain" - 
"key" comes before the optional ":chain".

I'm not sure if it's better to show that ":chain" is optional like this:

key_or_keyring:key[:chain]
     (explain restriction and optional :chain)

or to show it as separate entries

key_or_keyring:_key_
     (explain operation without :chain)

key_or_keyring:_key_:chain
     (explain operation with :chain)

The distinction with ":chain" is that the destination keyring is also 
searched for the signing key, in addition to the key or keyring specified 
by _key_.

If the key ID refers to a keyring, the signing key is looked up in that 
keyring. If the key ID refers to a key, only that individual key is 
considered as a possible signing key.
