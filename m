That's actually not quite true. There are plenty of software efforts out
there that use futex calls directly to implement userspace serialization
mechanisms as an alternative to the bulky sysv semaphores. I worked
closely with an in-memory DB project that makes heavy use of them. Not
everyone can simply rely on pthreads.

While kind of beyond the scope of documentation like manpages, I would
very much welcome this! The internet is full of
misleading/false/stupid/incomplete references to futexes and how to use
them. Having a best practises helps the kernel directly avoiding users
from misusing them.
