uid/git mapping are set up.

I've setup the mappings. If I look into /proc/*/status I see that my process has
all caps.
So, in general it is possible to drop cap within a user namespace?
I really want to drop CAP_NET_ADMIN and some others.
root within my container must not change any networking settings.

Hmm, I hoped that loginuid will be reset upon entering a user namespace.

Okay, I've asked because systemd is a heavy user of this file and
fails due to this
within a user namespace.
Luckily it is possible to remove all the score changes from the .service files.
