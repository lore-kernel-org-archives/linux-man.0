Eh.  From the sounds of it I'm not all that impressed at the isolation
and leakproofness of any of these schemes.  Regardless, I will rephrase
the manpage to emphasize more strongly that filesystems are under no
obligation to share inode numbers, privileged callers or otherwise.

Not to mention that I don't want to go xfs_igetting every inode across
the entire filesystem... :)
