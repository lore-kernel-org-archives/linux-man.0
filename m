Here, I think we need some words about how one obtains that 
file descriptor.

But there is no PID mentioned on this page?

I suppose:

As with
.BR kill (2),
the null signal (0) can be used to check if the process referred to by
.I fd
exists.

With sigqueue(3), one sends only a signal plus accompanying
data. It is of course based on the lower level rt_sigqueueinfo(2).
The man page for that system call says:

    These system calls are not intended for  direct  application  use;
    they  are  provided to allow the implementation of sigqueue(3) and
    pthread_sigqueue(3).

Is procfd_signal() intended to be the API directly used from
user space? If it is, then I think there should be some
explanation of why there is a 'siginfo_t' argument (vis-à-vis
sigqueue(3), which makes do with just union sigval).
If procfd_signal() is not intended to be the API used directly
from user space, then I think there needs to be a paragraph
similar to the one in the rt_sigqueueinfo(2) page queoted above.

"or process group"? I suspect a cut and paste error here :-)

The connection between the preceding sentence and the one
that follows it is not quite clear:

Is it the case that using procfd_signal() with a file
descriptor that refers to a zombie will yield EINVAL?
If yes, this could be made clearer with the following:

.B ESRCH
The specified process no longer exists or is a process in the
zombie state (a process that has terminated execution, but
has not yet been
BR wait (2)ed
for).
