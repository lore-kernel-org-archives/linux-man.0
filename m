That's good info. I am currently using set_user_sigmask() for it.
I'd really like to avoid having to pass in a sigset_t size for the
system call, however. What's the best way of achieving that? Can I get
away with doing something like this:

	if (in_compat_syscall()) {
		const compat_sigset_t __user *compat_sig;

		compat_sig = (const compat_sigset_t __user *) sig;
		ret = set_compat_user_sigmask(compat_sig, &ksigmask,
						&sigsaved, _NSIG_WORDS);
	} else {
		ret = set_user_sigmask(sig, &ksigmask, &sigsaved,
						_NSIG_WORDS);
	}
