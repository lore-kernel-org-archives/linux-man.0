About IMA with kernel module signing and kexec(not on x86_64 yet)...

Because IMA can be used to verify the integrity of kernel module or even
the image for kexec. I think that the
IMA_KEYRINGS_PERMIT_SIGNED_BY_BUILTIN_OR_SECONDARY must be enabled at runtime
when kernel is locked-down.

Because the root can enroll master key to keyring then IMA trusts the ima key
derived from master key. It causes that the arbitrary signed module can be loaded
when the root compromised.

Thanks
