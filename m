To trick glibc fuse would have to be mounted somewhere on /dev.

I think your original words sounded fine.  I would even go for new
programs may want to use the new ioctl as it fundamentally less racy
and more of what is actually trying to be implemented with the userspace
pieces.

I just wanted to point out that TIOCGPTPEER while being the interface
that it would have been nice had we had since the beginning (and would
have avoided all of the problems) is actually not something we need to
scramble and use it is just a very nice to have.  As the immediate
issues have been fixed in other ways.    It was not clear to me from the
other discussions if you and Michael Kerrisk were aware of the
mitigations that had been made to address the security issue.

The change to the behavior of /dev/ptmx may need to be documented
somewhere.   I am not certain if anything has been documented since
devpts has started allowing multiple mounts.
