Not really.

Let me try to explain.  I have three issues with the approach in your patch=
set:

1. You're introducing a new syscall, and it behaves differently on
32-bit and 64-bit because the structure you pass in is different.
This is necessary for old syscalls where compatibility matters, but
maybe we can get rid of it for new syscalls.   Could we define a
siginfo64_t that is identical to the 64-bit siginfo_t and just use
that in all cases?

2. Assuming that #1 doesn't work, then we need compat support.  But
you're doing it by having two different entry points.  Instead, you
could have a single entry point that calls in_compat_syscall() to
decide which structure to read.  This would simplify things because
x86 doesn't really support the separate compat entry points, which
leads me to #3.

3. The separate x32 numbers are a huge turd that may have security
holes and certainly have comprehensibility holes.  I will object to
any patch that adds a new one (like yours).  Fixing #1 or #2 makes
this problem go away.

Does that make any sense?  The #2 fix would be something like:

if (in_compat_syscall)
  copy...user32();
else
  copy_from_user();

The #1 fix would add a copy_siginfo_from_user64() or similar.
