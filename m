Yikes! That patch was buried in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet
in a disused lavatory. I unfortunately don't read every thread that comes
my way, especially if it doesn't look like a man-pages patch (i.e., falls
in the middle of an LKML thread that starts on another topic, and doesn't 
see linux-man@). I'll respond to that patch soon. (There are some problems
that mean I could not accept it, AFAICT.)

Thanks,

Michael
