Oh, yuck. Uuuh... can we make "struct files_struct" doubly-refcounted,
like "struct mm_struct"? One reference type to keep the contents
intact (the reference type you normally use, and the type used by
uring when the thread is running), and one reference type to just keep
the struct itself existing, but without preserving its contents
(reference held consistently by the uring thread)?
