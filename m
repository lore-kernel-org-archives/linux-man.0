First of all, currently it isn't possible to signal processes in an
ancestor pidns. Given the long thread about exit code visibility
semantics, I'm sure you see why bringing up this question is reasonable.

Some people (stupidly) bind-mount / into containers. There were several
CVEs in both LXC and runc where you could access the host filesystem
(including the host /proc). I'd prefer to not provide a mechanism for
such escalations to start sending signals to host processes, since I
don't see a strong reason why it should be allowed (and allowing it
would add more cracks to the isolation of pidns).

I think there is a huge difference between having read access to /proc
and being able to use /proc to signal processes which you ordinarily
would not be able to signal.

And another important point is that of semantics.

If we move forward with procfd_new() and the rest of the API we are
discussing, I'd argue we'd want to allow passing an nsfs fd to specify
what pidns we want the process to be created in (for procfd_new()). This
will obviously require a permission check to make sure we aren't
creating processes in a parent pidns -- and so for consistency all
procfd_* operations should have similar checks.
