Hmm, I'd like to clarify.

Whether it was intention or not, some of userspace developers thought
about that syscall drop pages instantly if was no-error return so that
they will see more free pages(ie, rss for the process will be decreased)
with keeping the VMA. Can we rely on it?

And we should make error section, too.
"locked" covers mlock(2) and you said you will add hugetlb. Then,
VM_PFNMAP? In that case, it fails. How can we say about VM_PFNMAP?
special mapping for some drivers?

One more thing, "The kernel is free to ignore the advice".
It conflicts "This call does not influence the semantics of the
application (except in the case of MADV_DONTNEED)" so
is it okay we can believe "The kernel is free to ingmore the advise
except MADV_DONTNEED"?

Thanks.
