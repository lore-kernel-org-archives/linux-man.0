If you are using proc/<pid>/ directories as your file descriptors, you
don't need to add an open or a release method at all.  The existing file
descriptors hold a reference to the inode which holds a reference the
the struct pid.

The only time you need to get a reference is when you need a task
and kill_pid_info already performs that work for you.

So using proc_pid is all you need to do to get the pid from the existing
file descriptors.
