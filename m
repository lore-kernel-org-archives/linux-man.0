That may be a bug with the user namespace permission check.  Perhaps we
shouldn't allow dropping groups that aren't mapped in the user
namespace.

To add to the discussion there are also sg and newgroup, though I don't
think they touch supplementary groups.

Frankly adding a no_new_privs check to allow something/anything scares
me.  That converts no_new_privs from something simple and easy to
understand to something much more complicated.

Josh I think it is time to stop and make certain you understand how
unix groups work in the large.

It seems to me that either supplementary groups can be dropped or
supplementary groups can not be dropped.  If they can be dropped we
shouldn't need complicated checks to allow them to be dropped in some
circumstances but not others.

Unix groups are an old interface and they have been used in a lot of
ways over the years.  We need to be careful any change we make is good
and truly backwards compatible and that we do our darndest not to
introduce security holes.
