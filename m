It looks like we already have a 'struct signalfd_siginfo' that is defined in a
sane architecture-independent way, so I'd suggest we use that.

We may then also want to make sure that any system call that takes a
siginfo has a replacement that takes a signalfd_siginfo, and that this
replacement can be used to implement the old version purely in
user space.

Is the current procfd_signal() proposal (under whichever name) sufficient
to correctly implement both sys_rt_sigqueueinfo() and sys_rt_tgsigqueueinfo()?
Can we implement sys_rt_sigtimedwait() based on signalfd()?
If yes, that would leave waitid(), which already needs a replacement
for y2038, and that should then also return a signalfd_siginfo.
My current preference for waitid() would be to do a version that
closely resembles the current interface, but takes a signalfd_siginfo
and a __kernel_timespec based rusage replacement (possibly
two of them to let us map wait6), but does not operate on procfd or
take a signal mask. That would require yet another syscall, but I
don't think I can do that before we want to have the set of y2038
safe syscalls.
