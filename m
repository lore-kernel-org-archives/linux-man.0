So, I changed that piece to:

       /dlgt_grp/cgroup.subtree_control
              Changing the ownership of this file  means  that  that  the
              delegatee  can  enable  controllers  (that  are  present in
              /dlgt_grp/cgroup.controllers) in order  to  further  redis‐
              tribute  resources  at lower levels in the subtree.  (As an
              alternative to changing the ownership  of  this  file,  the
              delegater  might  instead  add selected controllers to this
              file.)

Okay?

Oh -- and this reminds that I've been meaning to ask you for a while
now: could you please (please please please) CC all cgroup interface
changes to linux-api-u79uwXL29TY76Z2rM5mHXA@public.gmane.org (and prod others to do so
please). There have been many of these changes in recent times
(addition of new v2 controllers, thread mode, nsdelegate, the
changes that Roman made that you refer to above), and they really
all should have been CCed to linux-api@. It's often the only (easy)
way that I have to discover changes that should be documented in
the manual pages. And there are many other groups that are also
interested in tracking kernel-user-space interface changes; see 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/linux-api-ml.html

And I've already sent a separate mail re the cgroups(7) changes
relating to /sys/kernel/cgroup/*

Yes. See my separate mail.

Please please see my request regarding linux-api@ :-)

I see the change was in 4.11, commit 576dd464505fc53d501bb94569db76f220104d28

I rewrote that rule as follows, and moved it to the end of the list (i.e.,
the point XXX below):

       *  Before Linux 4.11: the effective UID of the writer  (i.e.,  the
          delegatee) matches the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID of
          the target process.  (This was a historical requirement  inher‐
          ited  from  cgroups v1 that was later deemed unnecessary, since
          the other rules suffice for containment in cgroups v2.)

I added the following:

       *  If  the  cgroup  v2  filesystem was mounted with the nsdelegate
          option, the writer must be able to see the source and  destina‐
          tion cgroup from its cgroup namespace.

Okay?

Thanks for the confirmation.
