So, I just want to check my understanding of a couple of points:

1. The commoncap LSM is invoked first, and if it denies access,
    then no further LSM is/needs to be called.

2. Is it the case that only one of the other LSMs (SELinux, Yama,
    AppArmor, etc.) is invoked, or can more than one be invoked.
    I thought only one is invoked, but perhaps I am out of date
    in my understanding.

Cheers,

Michael
