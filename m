Thanks! I did something like that. See below.

(Michal, would you have a text to propose to add to the mmap(2) page?
Maybe it would be useful to add something there.)

Thanks! I added this, but dropped in the word "immediately" in the last=20
sentence, since I assume that was implied. So now we have:

              After  a  successful MADV_DONTNEED operation, the seman=E2=80=
=90
              tics of  memory  access  in  the  specified  region  are
              changed:  subsequent accesses of pages in the range will
              succeed, but will result in either repopulating the mem=E2=80=
=90
              ory  contents from the up-to-date contents of the under=E2=80=
=90
              lying mapped file  (for  shared  file  mappings,  shared
              anonymous  mappings,  and shmem-based techniques such as
              System V shared memory segments) or  zero-fill-on-demand
              pages for anonymous private mappings.

              Note  that,  when applied to shared mappings, MADV_DONT=E2=80=
=90
              NEED might not lead to immediate freeing of the pages in
              the  range.   The  kernel  is  free to delay freeing the
              pages until an appropriate  moment.   The  resident  set
              size  (RSS)  of  the calling process will be immediately
              reduced however.

The current draft of the page can be found in a branch,

dvise

Thanks,

Michael
