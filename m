How about somethign like "This mount significantly reduces writes
needed to update the inode's timestamps, especially mtime and actime.
Examples of workloads where this could be a large win include frequent
random writes to preallocated files, as well as cases where the
MS_STRICTATIME mount option is enabled."?

(The advantage of MS_STRICTATIME | MS_LAZYTIME is that stat system
calls will return the correctly updated atime, but those atime updates
won't get flushed to disk unless the inode needs to be updated for
file system / data consistency reasons, or when the inode is pushed
out of memory, or when the file system is unmounted.)
