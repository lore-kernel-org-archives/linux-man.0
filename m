+BPF extensibility and applicability to networking, tracing, security
+in the linux kernel and several user space implementations of BPF
+virtual machine led to a number of misunderstanding on what BPF actually is.
+This short QA is an attempt to address that and outline a direction
+of where BPF is heading long term.
+
+Q: Is BPF a generic instruction set similar to x64 and arm64?
+A: NO.
+
+Q: Is BPF a generic virtual machine ?
+A: NO.
+
+BPF is generic instruction set _with_ C calling convention.
+
+Q: Why C calling convention was chosen?
+A: Because BPF programs are designed to run in the linux kernel
+   which is written in C, hence BPF defines instruction set compatible
+   with two most used architectures x64 and arm64 (and takes into
+   consideration important quirks of other architectures) and
+   defines calling convention that is compatible with C calling
+   convention of the linux kernel on those architectures.
+
+Q: can multiple return values be supported in the future?
+A: NO. BPF allows only register R0 to be used as return value.
+
+Q: can more than 5 function arguments be supported in the future?
+A: NO. BPF calling convention only allows registers R1-R5 to be used
+   as arguments. BPF is not a standalone instruction set.
+   (unlike x64 ISA that allows msft, cdecl and other conventions)
+
+Q: can BPF programs access instruction pointer or return address?
+A: NO.
+
+Q: can BPF programs access stack pointer ?
+A: NO. Only frame pointer (register R10) is accessible.
+   From compiler point of view it's necessary to have stack pointer.
+   For example LLVM defines register R11 as stack pointer in its
+   BPF backend, but it makes sure that generated code never uses it.
+
+Q: Does C-calling convention diminishes possible use cases?
+A: YES. BPF design forces addition of major functionality in the form
+   of kernel helper functions and kernel objects like BPF maps with
+   seamless interoperability between them. It lets kernel call into
+   BPF programs and programs call kernel helpers with zero overhead.
+   As all of them were native C code. That is particularly the case
+   for JITed BPF programs that are indistinguishable from
+   native kernel C code.
+
+Q: Does it mean that 'innovative' extensions to BPF code are disallowed?
+A: Soft yes. At least for now until BPF core has support for
+   bpf-to-bpf calls, indirect calls, loops, global variables,
+   jump tables, read only sections and all other normal constructs
+   that C code can produce.
+
+Q: Can loops be supported in a safe way?
+A: It's not clear yet. BPF developers are trying to find a way to
+   support bounded loops where the verifier can guarantee that
+   the program terminates in less than 4096 instructions.
+
+Q: How come LD_ABS and LD_IND instruction are present in BPF whereas
+   C code cannot express them and has to use builtin intrinsics?
+A: This is artifact of compatibility with classic BPF. Modern
+   networking code in BPF performs better without them.
+   See 'direct packet access'.
+
+Q: It seems not all BPF instructions are one-to-one to native CPU.
+   For example why BPF_JNE and other compare and jumps are not cpu-like?
+A: This was necessary to avoid introducing flags into ISA which are
+   impossible to make generic and efficient across CPU architectures.
+
+Q: why BPF_DIV instruction doesn't map to x64 div?
+A: Because if we picked one-to-one relationship to x64 it would have made
+   it more complicated to support on arm64 and other archs. Also it
+   needs div-by-zero runtime check.
+
+Q: why there is no BPF_SDIV for signed divide operation?
+A: Because it would be rarely used. llvm errors in such case and
+   prints a suggestion to use unsigned divide instead
+
+Q: Why BPF has implicit prologue and epilogue?
+A: Because architectures like sparc have register windows and in general
+   there are enough subtle differences between architectures, so naive
+   store return address into stack won't work. Another reason is BPF has
+   to be safe from division by zero (and legacy exception path
+   of LD_ABS insn). Those instructions need to invoke epilogue and
+   return implicitly.
+
+Q: Why BPF_JLT and BPF_JLE instructions were not introduced in the beginning?
+A: Because classic BPF didn't have them and BPF authors felt that compiler
+   workaround would be acceptable. Turned out that programs lose performance
+   due to lack of these compare instructions and they were added.
+   These two instructions is a perfect example what kind of new BPF
+   instructions are acceptable and can be added in the future.
+   These two already had equivalent instructions in native CPUs.
+   New instructions that don't have one-to-one mapping to HW instructions
+   will not be accepted.
+
+Q: BPF 32-bit subregisters have a requirement to zero upper 32-bits of BPF
+   registers which makes BPF inefficient virtual machine for 32-bit
+   CPU architectures and 32-bit HW accelerators. Can true 32-bit registers
+   be added to BPF in the future?
+A: NO. The first thing to improve performance on 32-bit archs is to teach
+   LLVM to generate code that uses 32-bit subregisters. Then second step
+   is to teach verifier to mark operations where zero-ing upper bits
+   is unnecessary. Then JITs can take advantage of those markings and
+   drastically reduce size of generated code and improve performance.
+
+Q: Does BPF have a stable ABI?
+A: YES. BPF instructions, arguments to BPF programs, set of helper
+   functions and their arguments, recognized return codes are all part
+   of ABI. However when tracing programs are using bpf_probe_read() helper
+   to walk kernel internal datastructures and compile with kernel
+   internal headers these accesses can and will break with newer
+   kernels. The union bpf_attr -> kern_version is checked at load time
+   to prevent accidentally loading kprobe-based bpf programs written
+   for a different kernel. Networking programs don't do kern_version check.
+
+Q: How much stack space a BPF program uses?
+A: Currently all program types are limited to 512 bytes of stack
+   space, but the verifier computes the actual amount of stack used
+   and both interpreter and most JITed code consume necessary amount.
+
+Q: Can BPF be offloaded to HW?
+A: YES. BPF HW offload is supported by NFP driver.
+
+Q: Does classic BPF interpreter still exist?
+A: NO. Classic BPF programs are converted into extend BPF instructions.
+
+Q: Can BPF call arbitrary kernel functions?
+A: NO. BPF programs can only call a set of helper functions which
+   is defined for every program type.
+
+Q: Can BPF overwrite arbitrary kernel memory?
+A: NO. Tracing bpf programs can _read_ arbitrary memory with bpf_probe_read()
+   and bpf_probe_read_str() helpers. Networking programs cannot read
+   arbitrary memory, since they don't have access to these helpers.
+   Programs can never read or write arbitrary memory directly.
+
+Q: Can BPF overwrite arbitrary user memory?
+A: Sort-of. Tracing BPF programs can overwrite the user memory
+   of the current task with bpf_probe_write_user(). Every time such
+   program is loaded the kernel will print warning message, so
+   this helper is only useful for experiments and prototypes.
+   Tracing BPF programs are root only.
+
+Q: When bpf_trace_printk() helper is used the kernel prints nasty
+   warning message. Why is that?
+A: This is done to nudge program authors into better interfaces when
+   programs need to pass data to user space. Like bpf_perf_event_output()
+   can be used to efficiently stream data via perf ring buffer.
+   BPF maps can be used for asynchronous data sharing between kernel
+   and user space. bpf_trace_printk() should only be used for debugging.
+
+Q: Can BPF functionality such as new program or map types, new
+   helpers, etc be added out of kernel module code?
+A: NO.

+This document provides information for the BPF subsystem about various
+workflows related to reporting bugs, submitting patches, and queueing
+patches for stable kernels.
+
+For general information about submitting patches, please refer to
+Documentation/process/. This document only describes additional specifics
+related to BPF.
+
+Reporting bugs:
+---------------
+
+Q: How do I report bugs for BPF kernel code?
+
+A: Since all BPF kernel development as well as bpftool and iproute2 BPF
+   loader development happens through the netdev kernel mailing list,
+   please report any found issues around BPF to the following mailing
+   list:
+
+     netdev@vger.kernel.org
+
+   This may also include issues related to XDP, BPF tracing, etc.
+
+   Given netdev has a high volume of traffic, please also add the BPF
+   maintainers to Cc (from kernel MAINTAINERS file):
+
+     Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
+     Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
+
+   In case a buggy commit has already been identified, make sure to keep
+   the actual commit authors in Cc as well for the report. They can
+   typically be identified through the kernel's git tree.
+
+   Please do *not* report BPF issues to bugzilla.kernel.org since it
+   is a guarantee that the reported issue will be overlooked.
+
+Submitting patches:
+-------------------
+
+Q: To which mailing list do I need to submit my BPF patches?
+
+A: Please submit your BPF patches to the netdev kernel mailing list:
+
+     netdev@vger.kernel.org
+
+   Historically, BPF came out of networking and has always been maintained
+   by the kernel networking community. Although these days BPF touches
+   many other subsystems as well, the patches are still routed mainly
+   through the networking community.
+
+   In case your patch has changes in various different subsystems (e.g.
+   tracing, security, etc), make sure to Cc the related kernel mailing
+   lists and maintainers from there as well, so they are able to review
+   the changes and provide their Acked-by's to the patches.
+
+Q: Where can I find patches currently under discussion for BPF subsystem?
+
+A: All patches that are Cc'ed to netdev are queued for review under netdev
+   patchwork project:
+
+     http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/
+
+   Those patches which target BPF, are assigned to a 'bpf' delegate for
+   further processing from BPF maintainers. The current queue with
+   patches under review can be found at:
+
+     https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/?delegate=77147
+
+   Once the patches have been reviewed by the BPF community as a whole
+   and approved by the BPF maintainers, their status in patchwork will be
+   changed to 'Accepted' and the submitter will be notified by mail. This
+   means that the patches look good from a BPF perspective and have been
+   applied to one of the two BPF kernel trees.
+
+   In case feedback from the community requires a respin of the patches,
+   their status in patchwork will be set to 'Changes Requested', and purged
+   from the current review queue. Likewise for cases where patches would
+   get rejected or are not applicable to the BPF trees (but assigned to
+   the 'bpf' delegate).
+
+Q: How do the changes make their way into Linux?
+
+A: There are two BPF kernel trees (git repositories). Once patches have
+   been accepted by the BPF maintainers, they will be applied to one
+   of the two BPF trees:
+
+     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/
+     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/
+
+   The bpf tree itself is for fixes only, whereas bpf-next for features,
+   cleanups or other kind of improvements ("next-like" content). This is
+   analogous to net and net-next trees for networking. Both bpf and
+   bpf-next will only have a master branch in order to simplify against
+   which branch patches should get rebased to.
+
+   Accumulated BPF patches in the bpf tree will regularly get pulled
+   into the net kernel tree. Likewise, accumulated BPF patches accepted
+   into the bpf-next tree will make their way into net-next tree. net and
+   net-next are both run by David S. Miller. From there, they will go
+   into the kernel mainline tree run by Linus Torvalds. To read up on the
+   process of net and net-next being merged into the mainline tree, see
+   the netdev FAQ under:
+
+     Documentation/networking/netdev-FAQ.txt
+
+   Occasionally, to prevent merge conflicts, we might send pull requests
+   to other trees (e.g. tracing) with a small subset of the patches, but
+   net and net-next are always the main trees targeted for integration.
+
+   The pull requests will contain a high-level summary of the accumulated
+   patches and can be searched on netdev kernel mailing list through the
+   following subject lines (yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the pull request):
+
+     pull-request: bpf yyyy-mm-dd
+     pull-request: bpf-next yyyy-mm-dd
+
+Q: How do I indicate which tree (bpf vs. bpf-next) my patch should be
+   applied to?
+
+A: The process is the very same as described in the netdev FAQ, so
+   please read up on it. The subject line must indicate whether the
+   patch is a fix or rather "next-like" content in order to let the
+   maintainers know whether it is targeted at bpf or bpf-next.
+
+   For fixes eventually landing in bpf -> net tree, the subject must
+   look like:
+
+     git format-patch --subject-prefix='PATCH bpf' start..finish
+
+   For features/improvements/etc that should eventually land in
+   bpf-next -> net-next, the subject must look like:
+
+     git format-patch --subject-prefix='PATCH bpf-next' start..finish
+
+   If unsure whether the patch or patch series should go into bpf
+   or net directly, or bpf-next or net-next directly, it is not a
+   problem either if the subject line says net or net-next as target.
+   It is eventually up to the maintainers to do the delegation of
+   the patches.
+
+   If it is clear that patches should go into bpf or bpf-next tree,
+   please make sure to rebase the patches against those trees in
+   order to reduce potential conflicts.
+
+   In case the patch or patch series has to be reworked and sent out
+   again in a second or later revision, it is also required to add a
+   version number (v2, v3, ...) into the subject prefix:
+
+     git format-patch --subject-prefix='PATCH net-next v2' start..finish
+
+   When changes have been requested to the patch series, always send the
+   whole patch series again with the feedback incorporated (never send
+   individual diffs on top of the old series).
+
+Q: What does it mean when a patch gets applied to bpf or bpf-next tree?
+
+A: It means that the patch looks good for mainline inclusion from
+   a BPF point of view.
+
+   Be aware that this is not a final verdict that the patch will
+   automatically get accepted into net or net-next trees eventually:
+
+   On the netdev kernel mailing list reviews can come in at any point
+   in time. If discussions around a patch conclude that they cannot
+   get included as-is, we will either apply a follow-up fix or drop
+   them from the trees entirely. Therefore, we also reserve to rebase
+   the trees when deemed necessary. After all, the purpose of the tree
+   is to i) accumulate and stage BPF patches for integration into trees
+   like net and net-next, and ii) run extensive BPF test suite and
+   workloads on the patches before they make their way any further.
+
+   Once the BPF pull request was accepted by David S. Miller, then
+   the patches end up in net or net-next tree, respectively, and
+   make their way from there further into mainline. Again, see the
+   netdev FAQ for additional information e.g. on how often they are
+   merged to mainline.
+
+Q: How long do I need to wait for feedback on my BPF patches?
+
+A: We try to keep the latency low. The usual time to feedback will
+   be around 2 or 3 business days. It may vary depending on the
+   complexity of changes and current patch load.
+
+Q: How often do you send pull requests to major kernel trees like
+   net or net-next?
+
+A: Pull requests will be sent out rather often in order to not
+   accumulate too many patches in bpf or bpf-next.
+
+   As a rule of thumb, expect pull requests for each tree regularly
+   at the end of the week. In some cases pull requests could additionally
+   come also in the middle of the week depending on the current patch
+   load or urgency.
+
+Q: Are patches applied to bpf-next when the merge window is open?
+
+A: For the time when the merge window is open, bpf-next will not be
+   processed. This is roughly analogous to net-next patch processing,
+   so feel free to read up on the netdev FAQ about further details.
+
+   During those two weeks of merge window, we might ask you to resend
+   your patch series once bpf-next is open again. Once Linus released
+   a v*-rc1 after the merge window, we continue processing of bpf-next.
+
+   For non-subscribers to kernel mailing lists, there is also a status
+   page run by David S. Miller on net-next that provides guidance:
+
+     http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/net-next.html
+
+Q: I made a BPF verifier change, do I need to add test cases for
+   BPF kernel selftests?
+
+A: If the patch has changes to the behavior of the verifier, then yes,
+   it is absolutely necessary to add test cases to the BPF kernel
+   selftests suite. If they are not present and we think they are
+   needed, then we might ask for them before accepting any changes.
+
+   In particular, test_verifier.c is tracking a high number of BPF test
+   cases, including a lot of corner cases that LLVM BPF back end may
+   generate out of the restricted C code. Thus, adding test cases is
+   absolutely crucial to make sure future changes do not accidentally
+   affect prior use-cases. Thus, treat those test cases as: verifier
+   behavior that is not tracked in test_verifier.c could potentially
+   be subject to change.
+
+Q: When should I add code to samples/bpf/ and when to BPF kernel
+   selftests?
+
+A: In general, we prefer additions to BPF kernel selftests rather than
+   samples/bpf/. The rationale is very simple: kernel selftests are
+   regularly run by various bots to test for kernel regressions.
+
+   The more test cases we add to BPF selftests, the better the coverage
+   and the less likely it is that those could accidentally break. It is
+   not that BPF kernel selftests cannot demo how a specific feature can
+   be used.
+
+   That said, samples/bpf/ may be a good place for people to get started,
+   so it might be advisable that simple demos of features could go into
+   samples/bpf/, but advanced functional and corner-case testing rather
+   into kernel selftests.
+
+   If your sample looks like a test case, then go for BPF kernel selftests
+   instead!
+
+Q: When should I add code to the bpftool?
+
+A: The main purpose of bpftool (under tools/bpf/bpftool/) is to provide
+   a central user space tool for debugging and introspection of BPF programs
+   and maps that are active in the kernel. If UAPI changes related to BPF
+   enable for dumping additional information of programs or maps, then
+   bpftool should be extended as well to support dumping them.
+
+Q: When should I add code to iproute2's BPF loader?
+
+A: For UAPI changes related to the XDP or tc layer (e.g. cls_bpf), the
+   convention is that those control-path related changes are added to
+   iproute2's BPF loader as well from user space side. This is not only
+   useful to have UAPI changes properly designed to be usable, but also
+   to make those changes available to a wider user base of major
+   downstream distributions.
+
+Q: Do you accept patches as well for iproute2's BPF loader?
+
+A: Patches for the iproute2's BPF loader have to be sent to:
+
+     netdev@vger.kernel.org
+
+   While those patches are not processed by the BPF kernel maintainers,
+   please keep them in Cc as well, so they can be reviewed.
+
+   The official git repository for iproute2 is run by Stephen Hemminger
+   and can be found at:
+
+     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git/
+
+   The patches need to have a subject prefix of '[PATCH iproute2 master]'
+   or '[PATCH iproute2 net-next]'. 'master' or 'net-next' describes the
+   target branch where the patch should be applied to. Meaning, if kernel
+   changes went into the net-next kernel tree, then the related iproute2
+   changes need to go into the iproute2 net-next branch, otherwise they
+   can be targeted at master branch. The iproute2 net-next branch will get
+   merged into the master branch after the current iproute2 version from
+   master has been released.
+
+   Like BPF, the patches end up in patchwork under the netdev project and
+   are delegated to 'shemminger' for further processing:
+
+     http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/?delegate=389
+
+Q: What is the minimum requirement before I submit my BPF patches?
+
+A: When submitting patches, always take the time and properly test your
+   patches *prior* to submission. Never rush them! If maintainers find
+   that your patches have not been properly tested, it is a good way to
+   get them grumpy. Testing patch submissions is a hard requirement!
+
+   Note, fixes that go to bpf tree *must* have a Fixes: tag included. The
+   same applies to fixes that target bpf-next, where the affected commit
+   is in net-next (or in some cases bpf-next). The Fixes: tag is crucial
+   in order to identify follow-up commits and tremendously helps for people
+   having to do backporting, so it is a must have!
+
+   We also don't accept patches with an empty commit message. Take your
+   time and properly write up a high quality commit message, it is
+   essential!
+
+   Think about it this way: other developers looking at your code a month
+   from now need to understand *why* a certain change has been done that
+   way, and whether there have been flaws in the analysis or assumptions
+   that the original author did. Thus providing a proper rationale and
+   describing the use-case for the changes is a must.
+
+   Patch submissions with >1 patch must have a cover letter which includes
+   a high level description of the series. This high level summary will
+   then be placed into the merge commit by the BPF maintainers such that
+   it is also accessible from the git log for future reference.
+
+Q: What do I need to consider when adding a new instruction or feature
+   that would require BPF JIT and/or LLVM integration as well?
+
+A: We try hard to keep all BPF JITs up to date such that the same user
+   experience can be guaranteed when running BPF programs on different
+   architectures without having the program punt to the less efficient
+   interpreter in case the in-kernel BPF JIT is enabled.
+
+   If you are unable to implement or test the required JIT changes for
+   certain architectures, please work together with the related BPF JIT
+   developers in order to get the feature implemented in a timely manner.
+   Please refer to the git log (arch/*/net/) to locate the necessary
+   people for helping out.
+
+   Also always make sure to add BPF test cases (e.g. test_bpf.c and
+   test_verifier.c) for new instructions, so that they can receive
+   broad test coverage and help run-time testing the various BPF JITs.
+
+   In case of new BPF instructions, once the changes have been accepted
+   into the Linux kernel, please implement support into LLVM's BPF back
+   end. See LLVM section below for further information.
+
+Stable submission:
+------------------
+
+Q: I need a specific BPF commit in stable kernels. What should I do?
+
+A: In case you need a specific fix in stable kernels, first check whether
+   the commit has already been applied in the related linux-*.y branches:
+
+     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/
+
+   If not the case, then drop an email to the BPF maintainers with the
+   netdev kernel mailing list in Cc and ask for the fix to be queued up:
+
+     netdev@vger.kernel.org
+
+   The process in general is the same as on netdev itself, see also the
+   netdev FAQ document.
+
+Q: Do you also backport to kernels not currently maintained as stable?
+
+A: No. If you need a specific BPF commit in kernels that are currently not
+   maintained by the stable maintainers, then you are on your own.
+
+   The current stable and longterm stable kernels are all listed here:
+
+     https://www.kernel.org/
+
+Q: The BPF patch I am about to submit needs to go to stable as well. What
+   should I do?
+
+A: The same rules apply as with netdev patch submissions in general, see
+   netdev FAQ under:
+
+     Documentation/networking/netdev-FAQ.txt
+
+   Never add "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" to the patch description, but
+   ask the BPF maintainers to queue the patches instead. This can be done
+   with a note, for example, under the "---" part of the patch which does
+   not go into the git log. Alternatively, this can be done as a simple
+   request by mail instead.
+
+Q: Where do I find currently queued BPF patches that will be submitted
+   to stable?
+
+A: Once patches that fix critical bugs got applied into the bpf tree, they
+   are queued up for stable submission under:
+
+     http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/bundle/bpf/stable/?state=*
+
+   They will be on hold there at minimum until the related commit made its
+   way into the mainline kernel tree.
+
+   After having been under broader exposure, the queued patches will be
+   submitted by the BPF maintainers to the stable maintainers.
+
+Testing patches:
+----------------
+
+Q: Which BPF kernel selftests version should I run my kernel against?
+
+A: If you run a kernel xyz, then always run the BPF kernel selftests from
+   that kernel xyz as well. Do not expect that the BPF selftest from the
+   latest mainline tree will pass all the time.
+
+   In particular, test_bpf.c and test_verifier.c have a large number of
+   test cases and are constantly updated with new BPF test sequences, or
+   existing ones are adapted to verifier changes e.g. due to verifier
+   becoming smarter and being able to better track certain things.
+
+LLVM:
+-----
+
+Q: Where do I find LLVM with BPF support?
+
+A: The BPF back end for LLVM is upstream in LLVM since version 3.7.1.
+
+   All major distributions these days ship LLVM with BPF back end enabled,
+   so for the majority of use-cases it is not required to compile LLVM by
+   hand anymore, just install the distribution provided package.
+
+   LLVM's static compiler lists the supported targets through 'llc --version',
+   make sure BPF targets are listed. Example:
+
+     $ llc --version
+     LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
+       LLVM version 6.0.0svn
+       Optimized build.
+       Default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
+       Host CPU: skylake
+
+       Registered Targets:
+         bpf    - BPF (host endian)
+         bpfeb  - BPF (big endian)
+         bpfel  - BPF (little endian)
+         x86    - 32-bit X86: Pentium-Pro and above
+         x86-64 - 64-bit X86: EM64T and AMD64
+
+   For developers in order to utilize the latest features added to LLVM's
+   BPF back end, it is advisable to run the latest LLVM releases. Support
+   for new BPF kernel features such as additions to the BPF instruction
+   set are often developed together.
+
+   All LLVM releases can be found at: http://releases.llvm.org/
+
+Q: Got it, so how do I build LLVM manually anyway?
+
+A: You need cmake and gcc-c++ as build requisites for LLVM. Once you have
+   that set up, proceed with building the latest LLVM and clang version
+   from the git repositories:
+
+     $ git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git
+     $ cd llvm/tools
+     $ git clone --depth 1 http://llvm.org/git/clang.git
+     $ cd ..; mkdir build; cd build
+     $ cmake .. -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="BPF;X86" \
+                -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF           \
+                -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release        \
+                -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=OFF
+     $ make -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
+
+   The built binaries can then be found in the build/bin/ directory, where
+   you can point the PATH variable to.
+
+Q: Should I notify BPF kernel maintainers about issues in LLVM's BPF code
+   generation back end or about LLVM generated code that the verifier
+   refuses to accept?
+
+A: Yes, please do! LLVM's BPF back end is a key piece of the whole BPF
+   infrastructure and it ties deeply into verification of programs from the
+   kernel side. Therefore, any issues on either side need to be investigated
+   and fixed whenever necessary.
+
+   Therefore, please make sure to bring them up at netdev kernel mailing
+   list and Cc BPF maintainers for LLVM and kernel bits:
+
+     Yonghong Song <yhs@fb.com>
+     Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
+     Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
+
+   LLVM also has an issue tracker where BPF related bugs can be found:
+
+     https://bugs.llvm.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=bpf
+
+   However, it is better to reach out through mailing lists with having
+   maintainers in Cc.
+
+Q: I have added a new BPF instruction to the kernel, how can I integrate
+   it into LLVM?
+
+A: LLVM has a -mcpu selector for the BPF back end in order to allow the
+   selection of BPF instruction set extensions. By default the 'generic'
+   processor target is used, which is the base instruction set (v1) of BPF.
+
+   LLVM has an option to select -mcpu=probe where it will probe the host
+   kernel for supported BPF instruction set extensions and selects the
+   optimal set automatically.
+
+   For cross-compilation, a specific version can be select manually as well.
+
+     $ llc -march bpf -mcpu=help
+     Available CPUs for this target:
+
+       generic - Select the generic processor.
+       probe   - Select the probe processor.
+       v1      - Select the v1 processor.
+       v2      - Select the v2 processor.
+     [...]
+
+   Newly added BPF instructions to the Linux kernel need to follow the same
+   scheme, bump the instruction set version and implement probing for the
+   extensions such that -mcpu=probe users can benefit from the optimization
+   transparently when upgrading their kernels.
+
+   If you are unable to implement support for the newly added BPF instruction
+   please reach out to BPF developers for help.
+
+   By the way, the BPF kernel selftests run with -mcpu=probe for better
+   test coverage.
+
+Q: In some cases clang flag "-target bpf" is used but in other cases the
+   default clang target, which matches the underlying architecture, is used.
+   What is the difference and when I should use which?
+
+A: Although LLVM IR generation and optimization try to stay architecture
+   independent, "-target <arch>" still has some impact on generated code:
+
+     - BPF program may recursively include header file(s) with file scope
+       inline assembly codes. The default target can handle this well,
+       while bpf target may fail if bpf backend assembler does not
+       understand these assembly codes, which is true in most cases.
+
+     - When compiled without -g, additional elf sections, e.g.,
+       .eh_frame and .rela.eh_frame, may be present in the object file
+       with default target, but not with bpf target.
+
+     - The default target may turn a C switch statement into a switch table
+       lookup and jump operation. Since the switch table is placed
+       in the global readonly section, the bpf program will fail to load.
+       The bpf target does not support switch table optimization.
+       The clang option "-fno-jump-tables" can be used to disable
+       switch table generation.
+
+     - For clang -target bpf, it is guaranteed that pointer or long /
+       unsigned long types will always have a width of 64 bit, no matter
+       whether underlying clang binary or default target (or kernel) is
+       32 bit. However, when native clang target is used, then it will
+       compile these types based on the underlying architecture's conventions,
+       meaning in case of 32 bit architecture, pointer or long / unsigned
+       long types e.g. in BPF context structure will have width of 32 bit
+       while the BPF LLVM back end still operates in 64 bit. The native
+       target is mostly needed in tracing for the case of walking pt_regs
+       or other kernel structures where CPU's register width matters.
+       Otherwise, clang -target bpf is generally recommended.
+
+   You should use default target when:
+
+     - Your program includes a header file, e.g., ptrace.h, which eventually
+       pulls in some header files containing file scope host assembly codes.
+     - You can add "-fno-jump-tables" to work around the switch table issue.
+
+   Otherwise, you can use bpf target. Additionally, you _must_ use bpf target
+   when:
+
+     - Your program uses data structures with pointer or long / unsigned long
+       types that interface with BPF helpers or context data structures. Access
+       into these structures is verified by the BPF verifier and may result
+       in verification failures if the native architecture is not aligned with
+       the BPF architecture, e.g. 64-bit. An example of this is
+       BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_MSG require '-target bpf'
+
+Happy BPF hacking!

-This document provides information for the BPF subsystem about various
-workflows related to reporting bugs, submitting patches, and queueing
-patches for stable kernels.
-
-For general information about submitting patches, please refer to
-Documentation/process/. This document only describes additional specifics
-related to BPF.
-
-Reporting bugs:
----------------
-
-Q: How do I report bugs for BPF kernel code?
-
-A: Since all BPF kernel development as well as bpftool and iproute2 BPF
-   loader development happens through the netdev kernel mailing list,
-   please report any found issues around BPF to the following mailing
-   list:
-
-     netdev@vger.kernel.org
-
-   This may also include issues related to XDP, BPF tracing, etc.
-
-   Given netdev has a high volume of traffic, please also add the BPF
-   maintainers to Cc (from kernel MAINTAINERS file):
-
-     Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
-     Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
-
-   In case a buggy commit has already been identified, make sure to keep
-   the actual commit authors in Cc as well for the report. They can
-   typically be identified through the kernel's git tree.
-
-   Please do *not* report BPF issues to bugzilla.kernel.org since it
-   is a guarantee that the reported issue will be overlooked.
-
-Submitting patches:
--------------------
-
-Q: To which mailing list do I need to submit my BPF patches?
-
-A: Please submit your BPF patches to the netdev kernel mailing list:
-
-     netdev@vger.kernel.org
-
-   Historically, BPF came out of networking and has always been maintained
-   by the kernel networking community. Although these days BPF touches
-   many other subsystems as well, the patches are still routed mainly
-   through the networking community.
-
-   In case your patch has changes in various different subsystems (e.g.
-   tracing, security, etc), make sure to Cc the related kernel mailing
-   lists and maintainers from there as well, so they are able to review
-   the changes and provide their Acked-by's to the patches.
-
-Q: Where can I find patches currently under discussion for BPF subsystem?
-
-A: All patches that are Cc'ed to netdev are queued for review under netdev
-   patchwork project:
-
-     http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/
-
-   Those patches which target BPF, are assigned to a 'bpf' delegate for
-   further processing from BPF maintainers. The current queue with
-   patches under review can be found at:
-
-     https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/?delegate=77147
-
-   Once the patches have been reviewed by the BPF community as a whole
-   and approved by the BPF maintainers, their status in patchwork will be
-   changed to 'Accepted' and the submitter will be notified by mail. This
-   means that the patches look good from a BPF perspective and have been
-   applied to one of the two BPF kernel trees.
-
-   In case feedback from the community requires a respin of the patches,
-   their status in patchwork will be set to 'Changes Requested', and purged
-   from the current review queue. Likewise for cases where patches would
-   get rejected or are not applicable to the BPF trees (but assigned to
-   the 'bpf' delegate).
-
-Q: How do the changes make their way into Linux?
-
-A: There are two BPF kernel trees (git repositories). Once patches have
-   been accepted by the BPF maintainers, they will be applied to one
-   of the two BPF trees:
-
-     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf.git/
-     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/bpf/bpf-next.git/
-
-   The bpf tree itself is for fixes only, whereas bpf-next for features,
-   cleanups or other kind of improvements ("next-like" content). This is
-   analogous to net and net-next trees for networking. Both bpf and
-   bpf-next will only have a master branch in order to simplify against
-   which branch patches should get rebased to.
-
-   Accumulated BPF patches in the bpf tree will regularly get pulled
-   into the net kernel tree. Likewise, accumulated BPF patches accepted
-   into the bpf-next tree will make their way into net-next tree. net and
-   net-next are both run by David S. Miller. From there, they will go
-   into the kernel mainline tree run by Linus Torvalds. To read up on the
-   process of net and net-next being merged into the mainline tree, see
-   the netdev FAQ under:
-
-     Documentation/networking/netdev-FAQ.txt
-
-   Occasionally, to prevent merge conflicts, we might send pull requests
-   to other trees (e.g. tracing) with a small subset of the patches, but
-   net and net-next are always the main trees targeted for integration.
-
-   The pull requests will contain a high-level summary of the accumulated
-   patches and can be searched on netdev kernel mailing list through the
-   following subject lines (yyyy-mm-dd is the date of the pull request):
-
-     pull-request: bpf yyyy-mm-dd
-     pull-request: bpf-next yyyy-mm-dd
-
-Q: How do I indicate which tree (bpf vs. bpf-next) my patch should be
-   applied to?
-
-A: The process is the very same as described in the netdev FAQ, so
-   please read up on it. The subject line must indicate whether the
-   patch is a fix or rather "next-like" content in order to let the
-   maintainers know whether it is targeted at bpf or bpf-next.
-
-   For fixes eventually landing in bpf -> net tree, the subject must
-   look like:
-
-     git format-patch --subject-prefix='PATCH bpf' start..finish
-
-   For features/improvements/etc that should eventually land in
-   bpf-next -> net-next, the subject must look like:
-
-     git format-patch --subject-prefix='PATCH bpf-next' start..finish
-
-   If unsure whether the patch or patch series should go into bpf
-   or net directly, or bpf-next or net-next directly, it is not a
-   problem either if the subject line says net or net-next as target.
-   It is eventually up to the maintainers to do the delegation of
-   the patches.
-
-   If it is clear that patches should go into bpf or bpf-next tree,
-   please make sure to rebase the patches against those trees in
-   order to reduce potential conflicts.
-
-   In case the patch or patch series has to be reworked and sent out
-   again in a second or later revision, it is also required to add a
-   version number (v2, v3, ...) into the subject prefix:
-
-     git format-patch --subject-prefix='PATCH net-next v2' start..finish
-
-   When changes have been requested to the patch series, always send the
-   whole patch series again with the feedback incorporated (never send
-   individual diffs on top of the old series).
-
-Q: What does it mean when a patch gets applied to bpf or bpf-next tree?
-
-A: It means that the patch looks good for mainline inclusion from
-   a BPF point of view.
-
-   Be aware that this is not a final verdict that the patch will
-   automatically get accepted into net or net-next trees eventually:
-
-   On the netdev kernel mailing list reviews can come in at any point
-   in time. If discussions around a patch conclude that they cannot
-   get included as-is, we will either apply a follow-up fix or drop
-   them from the trees entirely. Therefore, we also reserve to rebase
-   the trees when deemed necessary. After all, the purpose of the tree
-   is to i) accumulate and stage BPF patches for integration into trees
-   like net and net-next, and ii) run extensive BPF test suite and
-   workloads on the patches before they make their way any further.
-
-   Once the BPF pull request was accepted by David S. Miller, then
-   the patches end up in net or net-next tree, respectively, and
-   make their way from there further into mainline. Again, see the
-   netdev FAQ for additional information e.g. on how often they are
-   merged to mainline.
-
-Q: How long do I need to wait for feedback on my BPF patches?
-
-A: We try to keep the latency low. The usual time to feedback will
-   be around 2 or 3 business days. It may vary depending on the
-   complexity of changes and current patch load.
-
-Q: How often do you send pull requests to major kernel trees like
-   net or net-next?
-
-A: Pull requests will be sent out rather often in order to not
-   accumulate too many patches in bpf or bpf-next.
-
-   As a rule of thumb, expect pull requests for each tree regularly
-   at the end of the week. In some cases pull requests could additionally
-   come also in the middle of the week depending on the current patch
-   load or urgency.
-
-Q: Are patches applied to bpf-next when the merge window is open?
-
-A: For the time when the merge window is open, bpf-next will not be
-   processed. This is roughly analogous to net-next patch processing,
-   so feel free to read up on the netdev FAQ about further details.
-
-   During those two weeks of merge window, we might ask you to resend
-   your patch series once bpf-next is open again. Once Linus released
-   a v*-rc1 after the merge window, we continue processing of bpf-next.
-
-   For non-subscribers to kernel mailing lists, there is also a status
-   page run by David S. Miller on net-next that provides guidance:
-
-     http://vger.kernel.org/~davem/net-next.html
-
-Q: I made a BPF verifier change, do I need to add test cases for
-   BPF kernel selftests?
-
-A: If the patch has changes to the behavior of the verifier, then yes,
-   it is absolutely necessary to add test cases to the BPF kernel
-   selftests suite. If they are not present and we think they are
-   needed, then we might ask for them before accepting any changes.
-
-   In particular, test_verifier.c is tracking a high number of BPF test
-   cases, including a lot of corner cases that LLVM BPF back end may
-   generate out of the restricted C code. Thus, adding test cases is
-   absolutely crucial to make sure future changes do not accidentally
-   affect prior use-cases. Thus, treat those test cases as: verifier
-   behavior that is not tracked in test_verifier.c could potentially
-   be subject to change.
-
-Q: When should I add code to samples/bpf/ and when to BPF kernel
-   selftests?
-
-A: In general, we prefer additions to BPF kernel selftests rather than
-   samples/bpf/. The rationale is very simple: kernel selftests are
-   regularly run by various bots to test for kernel regressions.
-
-   The more test cases we add to BPF selftests, the better the coverage
-   and the less likely it is that those could accidentally break. It is
-   not that BPF kernel selftests cannot demo how a specific feature can
-   be used.
-
-   That said, samples/bpf/ may be a good place for people to get started,
-   so it might be advisable that simple demos of features could go into
-   samples/bpf/, but advanced functional and corner-case testing rather
-   into kernel selftests.
-
-   If your sample looks like a test case, then go for BPF kernel selftests
-   instead!
-
-Q: When should I add code to the bpftool?
-
-A: The main purpose of bpftool (under tools/bpf/bpftool/) is to provide
-   a central user space tool for debugging and introspection of BPF programs
-   and maps that are active in the kernel. If UAPI changes related to BPF
-   enable for dumping additional information of programs or maps, then
-   bpftool should be extended as well to support dumping them.
-
-Q: When should I add code to iproute2's BPF loader?
-
-A: For UAPI changes related to the XDP or tc layer (e.g. cls_bpf), the
-   convention is that those control-path related changes are added to
-   iproute2's BPF loader as well from user space side. This is not only
-   useful to have UAPI changes properly designed to be usable, but also
-   to make those changes available to a wider user base of major
-   downstream distributions.
-
-Q: Do you accept patches as well for iproute2's BPF loader?
-
-A: Patches for the iproute2's BPF loader have to be sent to:
-
-     netdev@vger.kernel.org
-
-   While those patches are not processed by the BPF kernel maintainers,
-   please keep them in Cc as well, so they can be reviewed.
-
-   The official git repository for iproute2 is run by Stephen Hemminger
-   and can be found at:
-
-     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/iproute2.git/
-
-   The patches need to have a subject prefix of '[PATCH iproute2 master]'
-   or '[PATCH iproute2 net-next]'. 'master' or 'net-next' describes the
-   target branch where the patch should be applied to. Meaning, if kernel
-   changes went into the net-next kernel tree, then the related iproute2
-   changes need to go into the iproute2 net-next branch, otherwise they
-   can be targeted at master branch. The iproute2 net-next branch will get
-   merged into the master branch after the current iproute2 version from
-   master has been released.
-
-   Like BPF, the patches end up in patchwork under the netdev project and
-   are delegated to 'shemminger' for further processing:
-
-     http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/project/netdev/list/?delegate=389
-
-Q: What is the minimum requirement before I submit my BPF patches?
-
-A: When submitting patches, always take the time and properly test your
-   patches *prior* to submission. Never rush them! If maintainers find
-   that your patches have not been properly tested, it is a good way to
-   get them grumpy. Testing patch submissions is a hard requirement!
-
-   Note, fixes that go to bpf tree *must* have a Fixes: tag included. The
-   same applies to fixes that target bpf-next, where the affected commit
-   is in net-next (or in some cases bpf-next). The Fixes: tag is crucial
-   in order to identify follow-up commits and tremendously helps for people
-   having to do backporting, so it is a must have!
-
-   We also don't accept patches with an empty commit message. Take your
-   time and properly write up a high quality commit message, it is
-   essential!
-
-   Think about it this way: other developers looking at your code a month
-   from now need to understand *why* a certain change has been done that
-   way, and whether there have been flaws in the analysis or assumptions
-   that the original author did. Thus providing a proper rationale and
-   describing the use-case for the changes is a must.
-
-   Patch submissions with >1 patch must have a cover letter which includes
-   a high level description of the series. This high level summary will
-   then be placed into the merge commit by the BPF maintainers such that
-   it is also accessible from the git log for future reference.
-
-Q: What do I need to consider when adding a new instruction or feature
-   that would require BPF JIT and/or LLVM integration as well?
-
-A: We try hard to keep all BPF JITs up to date such that the same user
-   experience can be guaranteed when running BPF programs on different
-   architectures without having the program punt to the less efficient
-   interpreter in case the in-kernel BPF JIT is enabled.
-
-   If you are unable to implement or test the required JIT changes for
-   certain architectures, please work together with the related BPF JIT
-   developers in order to get the feature implemented in a timely manner.
-   Please refer to the git log (arch/*/net/) to locate the necessary
-   people for helping out.
-
-   Also always make sure to add BPF test cases (e.g. test_bpf.c and
-   test_verifier.c) for new instructions, so that they can receive
-   broad test coverage and help run-time testing the various BPF JITs.
-
-   In case of new BPF instructions, once the changes have been accepted
-   into the Linux kernel, please implement support into LLVM's BPF back
-   end. See LLVM section below for further information.
-
-Stable submission:
-------------------
-
-Q: I need a specific BPF commit in stable kernels. What should I do?
-
-A: In case you need a specific fix in stable kernels, first check whether
-   the commit has already been applied in the related linux-*.y branches:
-
-     https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/stable/linux-stable.git/
-
-   If not the case, then drop an email to the BPF maintainers with the
-   netdev kernel mailing list in Cc and ask for the fix to be queued up:
-
-     netdev@vger.kernel.org
-
-   The process in general is the same as on netdev itself, see also the
-   netdev FAQ document.
-
-Q: Do you also backport to kernels not currently maintained as stable?
-
-A: No. If you need a specific BPF commit in kernels that are currently not
-   maintained by the stable maintainers, then you are on your own.
-
-   The current stable and longterm stable kernels are all listed here:
-
-     https://www.kernel.org/
-
-Q: The BPF patch I am about to submit needs to go to stable as well. What
-   should I do?
-
-A: The same rules apply as with netdev patch submissions in general, see
-   netdev FAQ under:
-
-     Documentation/networking/netdev-FAQ.txt
-
-   Never add "Cc: stable@vger.kernel.org" to the patch description, but
-   ask the BPF maintainers to queue the patches instead. This can be done
-   with a note, for example, under the "---" part of the patch which does
-   not go into the git log. Alternatively, this can be done as a simple
-   request by mail instead.
-
-Q: Where do I find currently queued BPF patches that will be submitted
-   to stable?
-
-A: Once patches that fix critical bugs got applied into the bpf tree, they
-   are queued up for stable submission under:
-
-     http://patchwork.ozlabs.org/bundle/bpf/stable/?state=*
-
-   They will be on hold there at minimum until the related commit made its
-   way into the mainline kernel tree.
-
-   After having been under broader exposure, the queued patches will be
-   submitted by the BPF maintainers to the stable maintainers.
-
-Testing patches:
-----------------
-
-Q: Which BPF kernel selftests version should I run my kernel against?
-
-A: If you run a kernel xyz, then always run the BPF kernel selftests from
-   that kernel xyz as well. Do not expect that the BPF selftest from the
-   latest mainline tree will pass all the time.
-
-   In particular, test_bpf.c and test_verifier.c have a large number of
-   test cases and are constantly updated with new BPF test sequences, or
-   existing ones are adapted to verifier changes e.g. due to verifier
-   becoming smarter and being able to better track certain things.
-
-LLVM:
------
-
-Q: Where do I find LLVM with BPF support?
-
-A: The BPF back end for LLVM is upstream in LLVM since version 3.7.1.
-
-   All major distributions these days ship LLVM with BPF back end enabled,
-   so for the majority of use-cases it is not required to compile LLVM by
-   hand anymore, just install the distribution provided package.
-
-   LLVM's static compiler lists the supported targets through 'llc --version',
-   make sure BPF targets are listed. Example:
-
-     $ llc --version
-     LLVM (http://llvm.org/):
-       LLVM version 6.0.0svn
-       Optimized build.
-       Default target: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
-       Host CPU: skylake
-
-       Registered Targets:
-         bpf    - BPF (host endian)
-         bpfeb  - BPF (big endian)
-         bpfel  - BPF (little endian)
-         x86    - 32-bit X86: Pentium-Pro and above
-         x86-64 - 64-bit X86: EM64T and AMD64
-
-   For developers in order to utilize the latest features added to LLVM's
-   BPF back end, it is advisable to run the latest LLVM releases. Support
-   for new BPF kernel features such as additions to the BPF instruction
-   set are often developed together.
-
-   All LLVM releases can be found at: http://releases.llvm.org/
-
-Q: Got it, so how do I build LLVM manually anyway?
-
-A: You need cmake and gcc-c++ as build requisites for LLVM. Once you have
-   that set up, proceed with building the latest LLVM and clang version
-   from the git repositories:
-
-     $ git clone http://llvm.org/git/llvm.git
-     $ cd llvm/tools
-     $ git clone --depth 1 http://llvm.org/git/clang.git
-     $ cd ..; mkdir build; cd build
-     $ cmake .. -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="BPF;X86" \
-                -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=OFF           \
-                -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release        \
-                -DLLVM_BUILD_RUNTIME=OFF
-     $ make -j $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN)
-
-   The built binaries can then be found in the build/bin/ directory, where
-   you can point the PATH variable to.
-
-Q: Should I notify BPF kernel maintainers about issues in LLVM's BPF code
-   generation back end or about LLVM generated code that the verifier
-   refuses to accept?
-
-A: Yes, please do! LLVM's BPF back end is a key piece of the whole BPF
-   infrastructure and it ties deeply into verification of programs from the
-   kernel side. Therefore, any issues on either side need to be investigated
-   and fixed whenever necessary.
-
-   Therefore, please make sure to bring them up at netdev kernel mailing
-   list and Cc BPF maintainers for LLVM and kernel bits:
-
-     Yonghong Song <yhs@fb.com>
-     Alexei Starovoitov <ast@kernel.org>
-     Daniel Borkmann <daniel@iogearbox.net>
-
-   LLVM also has an issue tracker where BPF related bugs can be found:
-
-     https://bugs.llvm.org/buglist.cgi?quicksearch=bpf
-
-   However, it is better to reach out through mailing lists with having
-   maintainers in Cc.
-
-Q: I have added a new BPF instruction to the kernel, how can I integrate
-   it into LLVM?
-
-A: LLVM has a -mcpu selector for the BPF back end in order to allow the
-   selection of BPF instruction set extensions. By default the 'generic'
-   processor target is used, which is the base instruction set (v1) of BPF.
-
-   LLVM has an option to select -mcpu=probe where it will probe the host
-   kernel for supported BPF instruction set extensions and selects the
-   optimal set automatically.
-
-   For cross-compilation, a specific version can be select manually as well.
-
-     $ llc -march bpf -mcpu=help
-     Available CPUs for this target:
-
-       generic - Select the generic processor.
-       probe   - Select the probe processor.
-       v1      - Select the v1 processor.
-       v2      - Select the v2 processor.
-     [...]
-
-   Newly added BPF instructions to the Linux kernel need to follow the same
-   scheme, bump the instruction set version and implement probing for the
-   extensions such that -mcpu=probe users can benefit from the optimization
-   transparently when upgrading their kernels.
-
-   If you are unable to implement support for the newly added BPF instruction
-   please reach out to BPF developers for help.
-
-   By the way, the BPF kernel selftests run with -mcpu=probe for better
-   test coverage.
-
-Q: In some cases clang flag "-target bpf" is used but in other cases the
-   default clang target, which matches the underlying architecture, is used.
-   What is the difference and when I should use which?
-
-A: Although LLVM IR generation and optimization try to stay architecture
-   independent, "-target <arch>" still has some impact on generated code:
-
-     - BPF program may recursively include header file(s) with file scope
-       inline assembly codes. The default target can handle this well,
-       while bpf target may fail if bpf backend assembler does not
-       understand these assembly codes, which is true in most cases.
-
-     - When compiled without -g, additional elf sections, e.g.,
-       .eh_frame and .rela.eh_frame, may be present in the object file
-       with default target, but not with bpf target.
-
-     - The default target may turn a C switch statement into a switch table
-       lookup and jump operation. Since the switch table is placed
-       in the global readonly section, the bpf program will fail to load.
-       The bpf target does not support switch table optimization.
-       The clang option "-fno-jump-tables" can be used to disable
-       switch table generation.
-
-     - For clang -target bpf, it is guaranteed that pointer or long /
-       unsigned long types will always have a width of 64 bit, no matter
-       whether underlying clang binary or default target (or kernel) is
-       32 bit. However, when native clang target is used, then it will
-       compile these types based on the underlying architecture's conventions,
-       meaning in case of 32 bit architecture, pointer or long / unsigned
-       long types e.g. in BPF context structure will have width of 32 bit
-       while the BPF LLVM back end still operates in 64 bit. The native
-       target is mostly needed in tracing for the case of walking pt_regs
-       or other kernel structures where CPU's register width matters.
-       Otherwise, clang -target bpf is generally recommended.
-
-   You should use default target when:
-
-     - Your program includes a header file, e.g., ptrace.h, which eventually
-       pulls in some header files containing file scope host assembly codes.
-     - You can add "-fno-jump-tables" to work around the switch table issue.
-
-   Otherwise, you can use bpf target. Additionally, you _must_ use bpf target
-   when:
-
-     - Your program uses data structures with pointer or long / unsigned long
-       types that interface with BPF helpers or context data structures. Access
-       into these structures is verified by the BPF verifier and may result
-       in verification failures if the native architecture is not aligned with
-       the BPF architecture, e.g. 64-bit. An example of this is
-       BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_MSG require '-target bpf'
-
-Happy BPF hacking!
