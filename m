Many of the pages that talk about system calls that have timeouts
carry similar language, since people often have confusions about what t=
ime
timeout (e.g., that it's an upper limit, not a minimum; or that it's pr=
ecise
to some very small granularity). Why do you think the language here is =
a
problem?
