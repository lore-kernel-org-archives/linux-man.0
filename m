That's correct.

There are a gazillion reasons why it can expire late, but the
guarantee is that it never expires prematurely.

Right.

That's only correct up to Linux 2.6.21.

Since 2.6.22 we have a priority ordered wakeup. For SCHED_OTHER
threads this takes the nice level into account. Threads with the same
priority are woken in FIFO order.

Yes, just remove it.

The condvar use case exposes the flaw nicely, but that's pretty much
true for everything which wants a sane requeue operation.

It's atomic as the other atomic operations on the futex word. It's
always performed with the proper lock(s) held in the kernel. That
means any concurrent operation will serialize on that lock(s). User
space has to make sure, that depending on the observed value no
concurrent operations happen, but that's something the kernel cannot
control.

It's correct.

Waiters:

  lock(A)
  while (!check_value(V)) {
  	unlock(A);
	block_on(B);
	lock(A);
  };
  unlock(A);

Note: B is a wait queue implemented with futexes.
 
If the waker would use FUTEX_WAKE and wake all waiters waiting on B
then those would all try to acquire lock A. That's called thundering
herd and pointless because all except one would immediately block on
lock A again.

Requeueing prevents that because it only wakes one waiter and moves
the other waiters to lock A. When that waiter unlocks A then the next
waiter can proceed ...

If there are multiple waiters on a pi futex then a wake pi operation
will wake the first waiter and hand over the lock to this waiter. This
includes handing over the rtmutex which represents the futex in the
kernel. The strict requirement is that the futex owner and the rtmutex
owner must be the same, except for the update period which is
serialized by the futex internal locking. That means the kernel must
update the user space value prior to returning to user space.

Well, that's hard to describe because the kernel only has a limited
way of detecting such mismatches. It only can detect it when there are
non PI waiters on a futex and a PI function is called or vice versa.

> .\" FIXME Somewhere on this page (I guess under the discussion of PI
> .\"       futexes) we need a discussion of the FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit.
> .\"       Can someone propose a text?

If a futex has a rtmutex associated in the kernel, i.e. when there are
blocked waiters, and the owner of the futex/rtmutex dies unexpectedly,
then the kernel cleans up the rtmutex (as it holds a reference to the
dying task) and hands it over to the next waiter. That requires that
the user space value is updated accordingly. The kernel sets the
FUTEX_OWNER_DIED in the user space value along with the TID of the new
owner. User space is responsible for cleaning this up, though there
are cases where the kernel does the cleanup.
 
The FUTEX_OWNER_DIED bit can also be set on uncontended futexes, where
the kernel has no state associated. This happens via the robust futex
mechanism. In that case the futex value will be set to
FUTEX_OWNER_DIED. The robust futex mechanism is also available for non
PI futexes.

'If that fails' does not make sense. If the user space access fails we
return -EFAULT and let user space deal with the mess.

The operation here is similar to the FUTEX_WAIT logic. When the user
space atomic acquire does not succeed because the futex value was non
zero, then the waiter goes into the kernel, takes the kernel internal
lock and retries the acquisition under the lock. If the acquisition
does not succeed either, then it sets the FUTEX_WAITERS bit, to signal
the lock owner that it needs to go into the kernel. Here is the pseudo
code:

		lock(kernel_lock);
	retry:
		
		/*
		 * Owner might have unlocked in userspace before we
		 * were able to set the waiter bit.
		 */
		if (atomic_acquire(futex) == SUCCESS) {
		   unlock(kernel_lock());
		   return 0;
		}

		/*
		 * Owner might have unlocked after the above atomic_acquire()
		 * attempt.
		 */
		if (atomic_set_waiters_bit(futex) != SUCCESS)
		   goto retry;

		queue_waiter();
		unlock(kernel_lock);
		block();

If this is the first waiter then there is no kernel state for this
futex, so it is created. That means the rtmutex is locked and the
futex owner established as the owner of the rtmutex. If there is a
waiter, then the state is reused, i.e. the new waiter is enqueued into
the rtmutex waiter list.

That also covers sched deadline.

If the highest priority waiter is SCHED_DEADLINE, then the owner
inherits cpu bandwidth from the waiter as there is no priority
associated to SCHED_DEADLINE tasks.

If the highest priority waiter is SCHED_FIFO/RR, then the owner
inherits the waiter priority.

T1 blocks on lock A held by T2
T2 blocks on lock B held by T3

So we have a lock chain A, B. The inheritance mechanism follows the
lock chain and propagates the highest waiter priority up to the end of
the chain.

That should be expressed differently:

     	    This operation tries to acquire the futex at uaddr. It's
     	    invoked when the user space atomic acquire did not
     	    succeed because the user space value was not 0.

	    The trylock in kernel might succeed because the user space
	    value contains stale state (FUTEX_WAITERS and or
	    FUTEX_OWNER_DIED). This can happen when the owner of the
	    futex died.

let me copy the pseudo code from cmp_requeue 

  lock(A)
  while (!check_value(V)) {
  	unlock(A);
	block_on(B);
	lock(A);
  };
  unlock(A);

So in this case B is the non-PI futex (the wait queue) and A is a PI
futex. So wait operation on B is the same as in FUTEX_WAIT.

This part should be removed:

  Yes. It's the same internal logic so it can return EAGAIN

No. We should probably fix that.

Correct. That handles the case:

	 requeue_pi(A, C);
