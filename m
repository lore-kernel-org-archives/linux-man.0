Ok, that's an easy switch to make.

Err... yes. :)

At the moment, neither btrfs nor XFS support it.

I don't think it'd be difficult for XFS (make a copy of the extent mappings in
the source area, increase the refcounts of those blocks, do the usual
punch-and-remap, then delete & decrement that copy of the mappings) but that
can come later.

I've updated the manpages and will repush the patchset ... optimistically,
when XFS reflink RFCv5 comes out, but sooner if anyone requests it. :)

Thank you for the review!
