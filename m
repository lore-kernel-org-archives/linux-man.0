Michael, thanks for working on the draft!  I'll review the draft closely
once you've sent it (or have I missed it?).

There are a few things that I'd like to see covered.

First, we should discuss that users, until they control all code in the
respective process, need to expect futexes to be affected by spurious
futex_wake calls; see https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/11/27/472 for
background and Linus' choice (AFAIU) to just document this.
So, for example, a return code of 0 for FUTEX_WAIT can mean either being
woken up by a FUTEX_WAKE intended for this futex, or a stale one
intended for another futex used by, for example, glibc internally.
(Note that as explained in this thread, this isn't just a glibc
artifact, but a result of the general futex design mixed with
destruction requirements for mutexes and other constructs in C++11 and
POSIX.)
It might also be necessary to further consider this when documenting the
errors, because it does affect how to handle them. See this for a glibc
perspective:
https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2014-09/msg00381.html

Second, the current documentation for EINTR is that it can happen due to
receiving a signal *or* due to a spurious wake-up.  This is difficult to
handle when implementing POSIX semaphores, because they require that
EINTR is returned from SEM_WAIT if and only if the interruption was due
to a signal.  Thus, if FUTEX_WAIT returns EINTR, the semaphore
implementation can't return EINTR from sem_wait; see this for more
comments, including some discussion why use cases relying on the POSIX
requirement around EINTR are borderline timing-dependent:
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=nptl/sem_waitcommon.c;h=96848d7ac5b6f8f1f3099b422deacc09323c796a;hb=HEAD#l282
Others have commented that aio_suspend has a similar issue; if EINTR
wouldn't in fact be returned spuriously, the POSIX-implementation-side
would get easier.

Third, I think it would be useful to -- somewhere -- explain which
behavior the futex operations would have conceptually when expressed by
C11 code.  We currently say that they wake up, sleep, etc, and which
values they return.  But we never say how to properly synchronize with
them on the userspace side.  The C11 memory model is probably the best
model to use on the userspace side, so that's why I'm arguing for this.
Basically, I think we need to (1) tell people that they should use
memory_order_relaxed accesses to the futex variable (ie, the memory
location associated with the whole futex construct on the kernel side --
or do we have another name for this?), and (2) give some conceptual
guarantees for the kernel-side synchronization so that one use this to
derive how to use them correctly in userspace.

The man pages might not be the right place for this, and maybe we just
need a revision of "Futexes are tricky".  If you have other suggestions
for where to document this, or on the content, let me know.  (I'm also
willing to spend time on this :) ).
