I'll make the time for that. I've wanted to see this for a while, so thank
you for working on it!

You're right in that a uaddr is a uaddr is a uaddr. Also "there is no such
thing as a futex", it doesn't exist as any kind of identifiable object, so
these discussions can get rather confusing :-)

A "futex" becomes a PI futex when it is "created" via a PI futex op code.
At that point, the syscall will ensure a pi_state is populated for the
futex_q entry. See futex_lock_pi() for example. Before the locks are
taken, there is a call to refill_pi_state_cache() which preps a pi_state
for assignment later in futex_lock_pi_atomic(). This pi_state provides the
necessary linkage to perform the priority boosting in the event of a
priority inversion. This is handled externally from the futexes via the
rt_mutex construct.

Clear as mud?

Briefly, these op codes exist to support a fairly specific use case:
support for PI aware pthread condvars (glibc patch acceptance STILL
PENDING FOR LOVE OF EVERYTHING HOLY WHY?!?!?! But is shipped with various
PREEMPT_RT enabled Linux systems. Because these calls are paired, and more
of the logic can happen on the kernel side (to preserve ownership of an
rt_mutex with waiters), so in order to ensure userspace and kernelspace
remain in sync, we pre-specify the target of the requeue in
futex_wait_requeue_pi. This also limits the attack surface by only
supporting exactly what it was meant to do. The corner cases get insane
otherwise.

We could walk through the various ways in which it would break if these
pairing restrictions were not in place, but I'll have to take some serious
time to page all those into working memory. Let me know if we need more
detail here and I will.

Thanks, and no objection from me.
