Hi Florian,

When I brought up this mremap 'duplicate mapping' functionality on the mm
mail list, most developers were surprised.  It seems this functionality exists
mostly 'by chance', and it was not really designed.  It certainly was never
documented.  There were suggestions to remove the functionality, which led
to my claim that it was being deprecated.  However, in hindsight that may
have been too strong.

I can drop this wording, but would still like to suggest memfd_create as
the preferred method of creating duplicate mappings.  It would be good if
others on Cc: could comment as well.

Just curious, does glibc make use of this today?  Or, is this just something
that you think may be useful.
