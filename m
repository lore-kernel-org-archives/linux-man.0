Hello.

While trying to add support for the new keyctl features (ability to
provide KDF and ability to restrict addition to the keyring) decoding
to strace, I've noticed that these are not documented, so here is
my initial attempt to document these things. Unfortunately, keys/crypto
infrastructure is quite foreign to me, so these patches definitely need
some improvement.

For the one part is definitely omitted yet is the documentation for the
"asymmetric" key type, which should be a part of keyrings.7, I think.

Thanks for all the feedback regarding the original version, I've tried to
incorporate it in this version of the patchset.

Changes since v1:
 * Added additional information about causes of EAGAIN, ENOENT, and
   ETIMEDOUT for the KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE operation.
 * Information about internal limit on hashname moved to the description
   of yet another cause of EINVAL for the KEYCTL_DH_COMPUTE.
 * The description of possible restriction specification for asymmetric
   key type has been corrected.
 * Added information about causes of ENOENT and EOPNOTSUPP for the
   KEYCTL_RESTRICT_KEYRING operation.
 * Added wildcard mention of the ENOMEM error code.
