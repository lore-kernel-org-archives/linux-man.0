I already did review with Arnd on those parts, I'll add linux-api and
linux-man for the next posting.

I guess we do.

Sure, fixed.

Good point, I'll switch to using that so we don't have to track it.

Was going to say it's safe because we always fill the ring inside the
ring mutex, but that won't work if we intermingle with non-polled IO.
I'll switch it to using the normal locked variant.

It basically serves two purposes:

1) When we grab multiple events, only have to update the actual ring
   tail once. This is a big deal, especially on archs where the barriers
   are more expensive.

2) It means the kernel tracks the sq tail and cq head, instead of
   completely relying on the application. This seems a much saner
   choice.

At least for polled IO, if we don't submit what we were asked to, then
we can't reliably poll for the passed in number of events. The
min_complete from the application could very well include the
expectation that to_submit were submitted as well.

I'll add a comment.

That would probably make it more readable, I'll make this change.

In the initial patch I agree, but with the later thread addition, I like
having it in a separate helper. At least for the start, the top side is
more trivial.

Why not use the page frag helpers? No point in open-coding it. I can
kill the zeroing, double call would be a bug anyway.

OK

I like having it nicely separated.

That does seem pointless, folded in.
