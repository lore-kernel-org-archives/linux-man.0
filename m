I'm not sure I understand your question.

Allowing the owner of a userns(or a holder of sufficient privilege in
that namespace) to create other types of namespaces in that userns is
safe, as long as there are no bug left.  There are plenty of ways for
the creator of a network namespace, mount namespace, or similar to
corrupt the user namespace to which they belong, which is why
unprivileged userns creators can only create new namespaces of other
types within the userns that they control.
