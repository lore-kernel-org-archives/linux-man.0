I don't understand "equally wrong" in your reply, I'm sorry. Do you
mean:

a) This error text should be there for both normal and PI requeues
OR
a) This error text should be there for neither normal nor PI requeues

Yes, sorry -- I should have said that I already found and fixed 
that problem.

Okay. I'll add a FIXME to the draft page, to see if we get some good 
text together to describe FUTEX_OWNER_DIED and how it is used.

Will do.

Thanks for the confirmation.
