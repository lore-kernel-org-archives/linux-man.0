Once I understand why threads and not process groups.  I don't see that
logic yet.

I don't know what you mean by all of the interesting signal system
calls.  I do know you can not replicate kill(2).

Sending signals to a process group the "kill(-pgrp)" case with kill
sends the signals to an atomic snapshot of processes.  If the signal
is SIGKILL then it is guaranteed that then entire process group is
killed with no survivors.

I am not certain you have.

That is fair.  I don't understand what you are doing with sending
signals to a thread.  That seems like one of the least useful
corner cases of sending signals.
