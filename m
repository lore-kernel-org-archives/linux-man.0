=46air enough. I plan to add the following text to the execve(2) man
page:

       In most cases where execve()  fails,  control  returns  to  the
       original  executable image, and the caller of execve() can then
       handle the error.  However, in (rare) cases  (typically  caused
       by resource exhaustion), failure may occur past the point of no
       return: the original exectable image has been  torn  down,  but
       the  new  image  could not be completely built.  In such cases,
       the kernel kills the process with a SIGKILL signal.

Comments?

Cheers,

Michael
