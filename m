Tanks for catching this!

So I've made that section of text:

        A  process  that  has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability can update =
the
        /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope file with one of the  follow=
ing
        values:

        0 ("classic ptrace permissions")
               No  additional  restrictions  on  operations  that  perf=
orm
               PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH checks (beyond those imposed by the c=
om=E2=80=90
               moncap and other LSMs).

               The use of PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.

        1 ("restricted ptrace") [default value]
               When    performing    an    operation   that   requires =
  a
               PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH check, the calling process  must  eit=
her
               have the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the user namespace=
 of
               the target process or it  have  a  predefined  relations=
hip
               with  the target process.  By default, the predefined re=
la=E2=80=90
               tionship is that the target process must be a child of  =
the
               caller.

               A  target  process  can  employ the prctl(2) PR_SET_PTRA=
CER
               operation to declare a different PID  that  is  allowed =
 to
               perform  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH  operations on the target.  =
See
               the kernel source file Documentation/security/Yama.txt  =
for
               further details.

               The use of PTRACE_TRACEME is unchanged.

        2 ("admin-only attach")
               Only  processes  with  the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in =
the
               user  namespace  of  the   target   process   may   perf=
orm
               PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH operations or trace children that emp=
loy
               PTRACE_TRACEME.

        3 ("no attach")
               No process may  perform  PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH  operations =
 or
               trace children that employ PTRACE_TRACEME.

               Once  this value has been written to the file, it cannot=
 be
               changed.

        With respect to values 1 and 2, note that creating a  user  nam=
es=E2=80=90
        pace effectively removes the Yama protection, because the owner=
 of
        a  namespace,  when  accessing  its  members  from  outside,   =
has
        CAP_SYS_PTRACE  within  the  namespace.   This  means  that whe=
n a
        process tries to use namespaces to  sandbox  itself,  it  inadv=
er=E2=80=90
        tently weakens the protections offered by the Yama LSM.


Okay?

Cheers,

Michael
