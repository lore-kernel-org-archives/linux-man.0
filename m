Hi Darren,

Some of my comments below will refer to the reply I just sent
to tglx (and the list) a few minutes ago.

Yes, I'll be sending out another draft (probably after a short delay,

Yes. But I don't think that needs to be called out explicitly here (?).

In the end, I'm not sure. This is (so far) my best attempt at trying
to convey an explanation of the behavior provided by the API.

So I've now reworked this passage to read:

       It  is  important  to  note that the kernel will update the fute=
x
       word's value prior to returning to user  space.   (This  prevent=
s
       the possibility of the futex word's value ending up in an invali=
d
       state, such as having an owner but the value being 0,  or  havin=
g
       waiters but not having the FUTEX_WAITERS bit set.)

Okay?

That's good. I've reworked a piece of the page to be:

       PI futexes are operated on by specifying one of the values liste=
d
       below  in  futex_op.   Note  that the PI futex operations must b=
e
       used as paired operations and  are  subject  to  some  additiona=
l
       requirements:

       *  FUTEX_LOCK_PI  and FUTEX_TRYLOCK_PI pair with FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI=
=2E
          FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI must be called only on a futex  owned  by  th=
e
          calling  thread, as defined by the value policy, otherwise th=
e
          error EPERM results.

       *  FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI pairs with  FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI.   Thi=
s
          must  be  performed from a non-PI futex to a distinct PI fute=
x
          (or the error EINVAL results).  Additionally, val (the  numbe=
r
          of  waiters  to  be  woken)  must  be  1  (or the error EINVA=
L
          results).

But see my question just above. I'll tweak the first bullet point a
little after I hear back from you.
