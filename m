I'm not sure I follow the above sentence, what do you mean by that?

I would definitely also add here that this helper is limited to cgroups v1
only, and that it works on clsact TC egress hook but not the ingress one.

The "generic classifier" part is a bit strange to parse. I would probably
leave the first part out and explain that this provides a means to tag
packets based on a user-provided ID for all traffic coming from the tasks
belonging to the related cgroup.

Could mention that this is a similar user provided tag like in the net_cls
case with cgroups only that this applies to routes here (dst entries) which
hold this tag.

Also, should say that this works with clsact TC egress hook or alternatively
conventional classful egress qdiscs, but not on TC ingress. In case of clsact
TC egress hook this has the advantage that the dst entry has not been dropped
yet in the xmit path. Therefore, the dst entry does not need to be artificially
held via netif_keep_dst() for a classful qdisc until the skb is freed.

I would add: s/at once from a packet/at once from a packet into the BPF stack/

Wrt seed, we should explicitly mention that this can be cascaded but also that
this helper works in combination with the l3/l4 csum ones where you feed in this
diff coming from bpf_csum_diff().

Also here the same remark with collect meta data I made earlier, and as a
particular example where this can be used in combination with geneve where
this allows for pushing and retrieving (bpf_skb_get_tunnel_opt() case)
arbitrary TLVs from the BPF program that allows for full customization.

Could mention the main use case for NAT64 out of an BPF program.
