No, I don't think we want that. Imho, It's not really helpful. Signals
are still delivered to zombies. If zombie state were to always mean that
no-one is going to wait on this thread anymore then it would make sense
to me. But given that zombie can also mean that someone put a
sleep(1000) right before their wait() call in the parent it seems odd to
report back that it is a zombie.

Yes, whenever you signal a process that has already been waited upon:
- get procfd handle referring to <proc>
- <proc> exits and is waited upon
- procfd_send_signal(procfd, ...) returns -1 with errno == ESRCH

See below.

Sigh, I get that but I really don't want to have to land this in one big
chunk. I want this syscall to go in in a as soon as we can to fulfill
the most basic need: having a way that guarantees us that we signal the
process that we intended to signal.

The thread case is easy to implement on top of it. But I suspect we will
quibble about the exact semantics for a long time. Even now we have been
on multiple - justified - detrous. That's all pefectly fine and
expected. But if we have the basic functionality in we have time to do
all of that. We might even land it in the same kernel release still. I
really don't want to come of as tea-party-kernel-conservative here but I
have time-and-time again seen that making something fancy and cover ever
interesting feature in one patchset takes a very very long time.

If you care about userspace being able to detect that case I can return
EOPNOTSUPP when a tid descriptor is passed.

You get EINVAL. When an O_PATH file descriptor is created the kernel
will set file->f_op = &empty_fops at which point the check I added 
        if (!proc_is_tgid_procfd(f.file))
                goto err;
will fail. Imho this is correct behavior since technically signaling a
struct pid is the equivalent of writing to a file and hence doesn't
purely operate on the file descriptor level.
