I'm not sure how useful it is to describe this to be optional.  In the
same sense, cgroup.procs would be optional too as the delegatee can
take control from its first children.  Users of course can choose to
do mix and match as they see fit but outside of the defined model,
there can be surprises - e.g. nsdelegate or some future delegation
aware feature can behave differently.  I think it'd be better to keep
it simple - either a subtree is delegated or not.

Roman recently added /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate and
/sys/kernel/cgroup/features.  The former contains newline separated
list of cgroup files which should be chowned on delegation (in
addition to the directory itself) and the latter contains optional
features (currently only nsdelegate).  Roman, can you please update
cgroup-v2.txt accordingly?

The file list was added because the cgroup OOM support added a knob
which belongs to the cgroup itself rather than the parent and we might
have more of those files in the future (not too likely and there won't
be many).

It could be also worthwhile to describe nsdelegate, which prevents
cgroup-namespaced delegatee, which may have the same UID as the
delegator, from writing to interface files in its cgroup root which
belong to the parent.

cgroup2 doesn't check the above anymore.

Also, if nsdelegate is enabled, both the source and destination
cgroups must be visible (cgroup namespace-wise) to the writer.

Yeah, that'd be the case.  Seeding of a delegated subtree should be
done by the delegator or before the priviledges are dropped.

Thanks.
