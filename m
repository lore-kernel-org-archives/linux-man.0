Ahhh -- thanks. I'd not understood that to be the case. Fixed now.

So, I've reworked that last piece somewhat to something
I hope is a little clearer:

        With respect to values 1 and 2, note  that  creating  a  new  u=
ser
        namespace  effectively  removes  the  protection  offered by Ya=
ma.
        This is because a process  in  the  parent  user  namespace  wh=
ose
        effective  UID matches the UID of the creator of a child namesp=
ace
        has all capabilities (including  CAP_SYS_PTRACE)  when  perform=
ing
        operations  within  the  child user namespace (and further-remo=
ved
        descendants of that  namespace).   Consequently,  when  a  proc=
ess
        tries  to  use user namespaces to sandbox itself, it inadverten=
tly
        weakens the protections offered by the Yama LSM.

No problem. Thanks for reviewing!
