What is "actime" in the preceding line? Should it be "ctime"?

I think some version of the following text could also usefully go 
into the page, but...

I find the wording of there a little confusing. Is the following 
a correct rewrite:

    The advantage of MS_STRICTATIME | MS_LAZYTIME is that stat(2)
    will return the correctly updated atime, but the atime updates
    will be flushed to disk only when (1) the inode needs to be 
    updated for filesystem / data consistency reasons or (2) the 
    inode is pushed out of memory, or (3) the filesystem is 
    unmounted.)

?

Thanks,

Michael
