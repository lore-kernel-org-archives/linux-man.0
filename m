Fwiw I'm not in favor of this.  Debian has a patch (I believe the one
I originally wrote for Ubuntu but which Ubuntu dropped long ago) adding a
sysctl, off by default, for enabling user namespaces.

Posix capabilities are intended for privileged actions, not for
actions which explicitly should not require privilege, but which
we feel are in development.

In general, the feeling is that putting a feature like this behind a
wall will only slow down the finding of any bugs, so I think the goal
itself is questionable.  But the chosen means for achieving your goal
are definately wrong.

There is.  One of Eric's primary motivations for user namespaces was to
finally allow unprivileged users to safely do things like manipulate
their mounts tree without the risk of privileged (setuid) programs
being tricked.
