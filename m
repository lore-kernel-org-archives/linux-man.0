Yes and no. "taskfd" is fine, since even if we do add a
kill-process-group capability, the general facility under discussion
is still *about* tasks in general, so "taskfd" still tells you in a
general sense what the thing does. "pidfd" would be wrong, and for the
same reason that the kernel's "struct pid" is badly-named: the object
being named is a *task*, and signaling a particular task instead of
whatever task happens to be labeled with a particular numeric PID at
the time of all is the whole point of this change.

To the extent that it's possible, this system call should mimic the
behavior of a signal-send to a positive numeric PID (i.e., a specific
task), so if we change one, we should change both.
