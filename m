Okay -- if you do think of something, I'd be very happy to add it to
the man page.

I think I needed to be more explicit in my description of "reversion". 
I mean this situation, where we have written "threaded" to 
t1/t1-a/cgroup.type:

    t1 [dt]
        t1-a [t]
        t1-b [inv]
            t1-c [inv]

t1 is in the "domain threaded" state, and t1/t1-b and t1/t1-b/t1-c
are "domain invalid". If we now remove the t1/t1-a cgroup,
then the various other cgroups revert to type "domain":

    t1 [d]
        t1-b [d]
            t1-c [d]

And my point was that I wondered whether that had any relevance
in this discussion of why the "domain invalid" state exists.
Maybe it is irrelevant, but it just occurred to me that maybe it
is relevant.

Cheers,

Michael
