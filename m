That's a bit more expected though.  "I called malloc and my address
space changed".  Well, yeah.  But "I called getpwnam and my address
space changed" is a bit more surprising.  Don't you think?

Maybe that should be up front rather than buried at the end of the sentence.

"In a multi-threaded process, the address space can change in response to
virtually any library call.  This is because almost any library call may be
implemented by using dlopen(3) to load another shared library, which will be
mapped into the process's address space.  The PAM libraries are an excellent
example, as well as more obvious examples like brk(2), malloc(3) and even
pthread_create(3)."

What do you think?
