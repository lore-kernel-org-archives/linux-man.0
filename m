Yeah, its not very straightforward, I was also scratching my head. First
we do:

	if (requeue_pi) {
		/*
		 * Requeue PI only works on two distinct uaddrs. This
		 * check is only valid for private futexes. See below.
		 */
		if (uaddr1 == uaddr2)
			return -EINVAL;

Then:

	/*
	 * The check above which compares uaddrs is not sufficient for
	 * shared futexes. We need to compare the keys:
	 */
	if (requeue_pi && match_futex(&key1, &key2)) {
		ret = -EINVAL;
		goto out_put_keys;
	}

I wonder why we're checking for requeue_pi again, when, at least
according to the comments, it should be for shared. I guess it would
make sense depending on the mappings as the keys are the only true way
of determining if both futexes are the same, so perhaps:

	if ((requeue_pi || (flags & FLAGS_SHARED)) && match_futex())

That would also align with the retry labels.

Thanks,
