Yeah.  I am defintiely not designing for that.

Agreed.

That is a pretty decent argument.    I will take a good stare at this
issue as I refresh these patches and see how close to perfection I can
make them.

I thought a dedicated word might be easier.  I don't know that it makes
much of a difference at this point.

The DEC Alpha at least used to be able to violate causality in ways
weird enough to confuse anyone, and the alpha still seems to be in the
tree.  What keyed me in was the part in atomic_ops.txt that says these
things don't have barriers and you will probably need them, and I
remember spin locks tend to take care of all those issues for you. 

Anyway thanks for your barrier pointer.
