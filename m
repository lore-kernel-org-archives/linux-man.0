But not infinitely so. The x32 ABI starts at 512, and right now I see
334 syscalls on x86_64. So the next 178 people can say "let's just
define a syscall", and after that? I suppose we could move to setting
BIT(10), but how much userspace assumes > 512 => compat syscall and
blocks it via seccomp or whatever?

Contrast that with the ioctl space, which is an unsigned long and
fairly sparse still (Documentation/ioctl/ioctl-number.txt).

I suppose it's obvious, but I disagree.

For user-defined values of "worse" :)
