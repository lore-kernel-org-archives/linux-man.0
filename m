It may make sense to reach out to some place like oss-security.

FWIW, I think we should ask, at the same time, about:

 - Dropping supplementary groups.
 - Switching gid/egid/sgid to a supplementary group.
 - Denying ptrace of a process with supplementary groups that the
tracer doesn't have.

Also, I much prefer a sysctl to a boot option.  Boot options are nasty
to configure in many distributions.
