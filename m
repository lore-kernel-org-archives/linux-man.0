Hello David,

Thanks for your comments. Some questions below.

Already reported, and fixed.

Done.

I think the question is rather: what is going to be done to the API?
Will it be changed as Dmitry suggests?

Yes. Changed as you suggest.

Having two ways to do something is odd, and redundant. Note
of the other APIs that provide this functionality do so
in both ways, AFAIK. It's not a big problem, but certainly
strange. If you settle on having just one, then I'd say
choose AT_EMPTY_PATH.

Under ERRORS I added:

.TP
.B EINVAL
Reserved flag specified in
.IR mask .

Okay?

You say "in there somewhere", but it's not quite clear to me which piece 
this applies to. Could you propose a wording please.

I don't know what you mean to say here. Do you mean some
text in the page should change?

Probably the same order as the struct.

Added.

Added. But, what does "no usable value here" mean? (The relationship
between stx_attributes_mask and stx_attributes still isn't
so clear to me.

Cheers,
