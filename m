Personally I don't find the presence of sandboxing features to be a very good
excuse for introducing random insecure ioctls.  Not everyone has everything
perfectly "sandboxed" all the time, for obvious reasons.  It's easy to forget
about the filesystem ioctls, too, since they can be executed on any regular
file, without having to open some device node in /dev.

(And this actually does happen; the SELinux policy in Android, for example,
still allows apps to call any ioctl on their data files, despite all the effort
that has gone into whitelisting other types of ioctls.  Which should be fixed,
of course, but it shows that this kind of mistake is very easy to make.)

Well, only if that someone running GETFSMAP actually wants to watch things in
real-time (it's not necessary for all scenarios that have been mentioned), *and*
there is monitoring in place which actually detects it and can do something
about it.

Yes, PIDs have traditionally been global, but today we have PID namespaces, and
many other isolation features such as mount namespaces.  Nothing is perfect, of
course, and containers are a lot worse than VMs, but it seems weird to use that
as an excuse to knowingly make things worse...

So why does the ioctl need to return all extent mappings for the entire
filesystem, instead of just the share count of each block in the file that the
ioctl is called on?
