+.TH IOCTL-FICLONE 2 2015-12-15 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+ioctl_ficlone \- share all the data of one file with another file
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.br
+.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int ioctl(int " dest_fd ", FICLONE, int " src_fd );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple
+files ("reflink"), this
+.BR ioctl (2)
+system call can be used to make all the data in the
+.B src_fd
+file appear in the
+.B dest_fd
+file by sharing the underlying storage, which is faster than making a separate
+physical copy of the data.  If a file write should occur to a shared region,
+the filesystem must ensure that the changes remain private to the file being
+written.  This behavior is commonly referred to as "copy on write".
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set to indicate the error.
+.PP
+.SH ERRORS
+Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:
+.TP
+.B EXDEV
+.IR dest_fd " and " src_fd
+are not on the same mounted filesystem.
+.TP
+.B EISDIR
+One of the files is a directory and the filesystem does not support shared
+regions in directories.
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+The filesystem does not support reflinking the ranges of the given files.  This
+error can also appear if either file descriptor represents a device, fifo, or
+socket.
+.TP
+.B EBADF
+.IR src_fd
+is not open for reading;
+.IR dest_fd
+is not open for writing or is open for append-only writes; or the filesystem
+which
+.IR src_fd
+resides on does not support reflink.
+.TP
+.B EPERM
+.IR dest_fd
+is immutable.
+.TP
+.B ETXTBSY
+One of the files is a swap file.  Swap files cannot share storage.
+.TP
+.B EOPNOTSUPP
+This can appear if the filesystem does not support reflinking either file
+descriptor.
+.SH NOTES
+Because a copy on write operation requires the allocation of new storage, the
+.B fallocate (2)
+operation may un-share shared blocks to guarantee that subsequent writes will
+not fail because of lack of disk space.
+.SH CONFORMING TO
+This API is Linux-specific.  This ioctl was previously known as
+.B BTRFS_IOC_CLONE
+and was private to btrfs.

+.TH IOCTL-FICLONERANGE 2 2015-12-15 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+ioctl_ficlonerange \- share some the data of one file with another file
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.br
+.B #include <sys/ioctl.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int ioctl(int " dest_fd ", FICLONERANGE, struct file_clone_range * " arg );
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+If a filesystem supports files sharing physical storage between multiple
+files ("reflink"), this
+.BR ioctl (2)
+system call can be used to make some of the data in the
+.B src_fd
+file appear in the
+.B dest_fd
+file by sharing the underlying storage, which is faster than making a separate
+physical copy of the data.  If a file write should occur to a shared region,
+the filesystem must ensure that the changes remain private to the file being
+written.  This behavior is commonly referred to as "copy on write".
+
+This ioctl reflinks up to
+.IR src_length
+bytes from file descriptor
+.IR src_fd
+at offset
+.IR src_offset
+into the file
+.IR dest_fd
+at offset
+.IR dest_offset ",
+provided that both are files.  This information is conveyed in a structure of
+the following form:
+.in +4n
+.nf
+
+struct file_clone_range {
+        __s64 src_fd;
+        __u64 src_offset;
+        __u64 src_length;
+        __u64 dest_offset;
+};

+.fi
+.in
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set to indicate the error.

+.SH ERRORS
+Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

+are not on the same mounted filesystem.
+.TP
+.B EISDIR
+One of the files is a directory and the filesystem does not support shared
+regions in directories.
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+The filesystem does not support reflinking the ranges of the given files.  This
+error can also appear if either file descriptor represents a device, fifo, or
+socket.  Disk filesystems generally require the offset and length arguments
+to be aligned to the fundamental block size.  Not all filesystems support
+overlapping reflink ranges in the same file.
+.TP
