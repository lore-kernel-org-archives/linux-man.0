Hi,

As-is, this could probably live in
Documentation/security/no-new-privs.txt (maybe with some examples
added).

As for a manpage section, I think Michael Kerrisk would happily add a
section for PR_[SG]ET_NO_NEW_PRIVS to prctl if this could be
summarized into a paragraph or two.

(And this reminds me I should send an update for the seccomp section
in the prctl manpage too.)
