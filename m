A couple of quick comments on this patch.

1) user namespaces already allow you to do this.

2) After having looked at the group case I am afraid this intersects in
   an unfortunate way with user namespaces.

3) This intersects in a very unfortunate way with setresuid.
   Applications that today know they are dropping all privileges
   won't be dropping all privielges with this change.  Which sounds like
   a recipe for a security exploit to me.
