Ok, let's try to be constructive. I understand the general concern for
the future so let's put a contract into the commit message stating that
the width of the target aka *what is signaled* will be based on a flag
parameter if we ever extend it:

taskfd_send_signal(fd, SIGSTOP, NULL, TASKFD_PGID);
taskfd_send_signal(fd, SIGSTOP, NULL, TASKFD_TID);

with the current default being

taskfd_send_signal(fd, SIGSTOP, NULL, TASKFD_PID);

This seems to me the cleanest solution as we only use one type of file
descriptor. Can everyone be on board with this? If so I'm going to send
out a new version of the patch.

Christian
