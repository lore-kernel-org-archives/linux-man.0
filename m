You are going to have to work very hard to convince me this is
unnecessarily restrictive.

Yes.  I realized just after I sent the patch that setgroups(0, NULL)
would still work without a mapping set.  That is a first glass grade a
oversight that resulted in a bug.  None of the other uid or gid changing
syscalls without a mapping set, and setgroups was just overlooked
because it was different.  Oops.

I will send an updated patch that stops setgroups from working without
a mapping set shortly.

Being able to call setgroups is fundamental to login programs, and login
programs are one of the things user namespaces need to support.  So
adding an extra flag and an extra place where privilege is required
is just noise, and will wind up breaking every user of user namespaces.

Further being able to setup uid and gid mappings without privilege is
primarily a nice to have.  The original design did not have unprivileged
setting of uid and gid maps and if it proves insecure I goofed and the
feature isn't safe so it needs to be removed.

This does mean that running a system with negative groups and users
delegated subordinate gids in /etc/subuid is a bad idea and system
administrators shouldn't do that as those negative groups won't prove
effective in stopping their users.  But this is all under system
administrator control so shrug.  There isn't a way to avoid that
fundamental conflict.

That proposal sounds a lot more restrictive and a lot more of a pain
to use than what I have implemented in my patch.

Definitely more complicated and I can't imagine a case where I need
a gid map without needing to call setgroups.
