That was the intent when the distinction was introduced, but it doesn't
appear to have been properly maintained, e.g. there is now a common
helper lock_trace() that is used for
/proc/pid/{stack,syscall,personality} but checks PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH, an=
d
PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH is also used in timerslack_ns_write/show().  Likely
should review and make them consistent.  There was also some debate
about proper handling of /proc/pid/fd.  Arguably that one might belong
back in the _ATTACH camp.

Some ptrace access mode checks, such as checks when reading
/proc/pid/stat, merely cause the output to be filtered/sanitized rather
than an error to be returned to the caller.  In these cases, accessing
the file is not a security violation and there is no reason to generate
a security audit record.  This modifier suppresses the generation of
such an audit record for the particular access check.
