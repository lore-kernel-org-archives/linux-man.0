This is correct.
If you want it globally you can still use LSM.

And what about all the other kernel features?
I really don't get why you choose user namespaces as your enemy.

This argument is bogus and you know that too.

As I said, it really don't see why we should treat user namespaces in a special
way. It is a kernel feature like many others are. If you don't trust it, disable it.
