I'm the writer of this patch so take this with a grain of salt.
I think it is a bad idea to stop this patch and force us to introduce a
new type of ioctl().
An ioctl() is also not easy to use for this task because we want to add
a siginfo_t argument which I actually think provides value and makes
this interface more useful.
