How about something like this?

              For  cases in which MAP_FIXED can not be used because
the specified memory
              region has not been reserved using an existing mapping,
newer kernels
              (Linux  4.17  and  later)  provide  an  option
MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE  that
              should  be  used  instead. Older kernels require the
              caller to use addr as a hint and take appropriate action if
              the kernel places the new mapping at a different address.

John, Michael, what do you think?
