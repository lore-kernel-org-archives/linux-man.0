Thanks, Darren, that's really helpful! I've removed the statement in the man
page that FUTEX_REQUEUE is broken.

By the way, Darren. There were a couple of FIXMEs in the page where you are
explicitly mentioned by name. Could you take a look at those? Specifically,
the large block of text starting at:

    >> .\" FIXME XXX The following is my attempt at a definition of PI futexes,
    >> .\"       based on mail discussions with Darren Hart. Does it seem okay?

   (tglx looked at this and blessed it, but I'd like you also to check.)

Cheers,

Michael
