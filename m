It's not complete solution. But, I don't think this is incorrect solution
as well. Potential issue could be more serious than improvement of signal
responsiveness.

In practice, node.js (Currently, It doesn't check -EINTR of cacheflush)
crashes occasionally and non-reproducibly at some point some while after
the cacheflush call. At that time, strace tells cacheflush returns -EINTR.

In worst case, I can imagine that periodic signal interrupts cacheflush
and it repeats restart of syscall from start of address with unlucky timing.
