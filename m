You may have the common issue that uid 0 tends to regain capabilities
on exec due to "legacy" capability emulation.  Try playing with
securebits and/or the bounding set.  (The setpriv command in very new
util-linux-ng makes this easy to play with.)

Note that you almost certainly want to set no_new_privs if anything
other than uid 0 is running with non-default securebits.
