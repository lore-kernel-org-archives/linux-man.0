So, I completely agree with you, and I agree that this could be better.
At first, I understood your meaning to be that I should avoid all of th=
e
detail, and just limit the man page to some very high level text as
you proposed. So, I think it's worth prefixing the details with some
attempt at a high-level picture. How about this as an introductory
paragraph:

        Various parts of the kernel-user-space API (not just  ptrace(2)
        operations),  require  so-called  "ptrace  access mode" checks,
        whose outcome determines whether an operation is permitted (or,
        in  a  few cases, causes a "read" operation to return sanitized
        data).  These checks are performed in cases where  one  process
        can  inspect sensitive information about, or in some cases mod=E2=
=80=90
        ify the state of, another process.  The  checks  are  based  on
        factors  such  as  the  credentials and capabilities of the two
        processes, whether or not the "target" process is dumpable, and
        the  results  of checks performed by any enabled Linux Security
        Module (LSM)=E2=80=94for example, SELinux, Yama, or  Smack=E2=80=
=94and  by  the
        commoncap LSM (which is always invoked).

Maybe people will even write man page patches when that happens :-).

Cheers,
