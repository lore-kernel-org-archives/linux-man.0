This sounds fine to me. I probably should point out that I wrote a patch for
glibc to use TIOCGPTPEER based slave fd allocation when supported and only =
use
the insecure way as a fallback. I've pushed this to glibc master on 8 Octob=
er.
That means it is still in our current glibc development cycle and will thus=
 be
available in glibc 2.27. The relevant commit hash is
645ac9aaf89e3311949828546df6334322f48933 and the link to the diff
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=3Dglibc.git;a=3Dcommitdiff;h=3D645ac9aaf89e33=
11949828546df6334322f48933;hp=3D98e0742024d4c13c08a6076b3d119c250e7d0118

At least for us at glibc this should mean that *most* insecure
path-based-operations have been eliminated since other path-based bits in t=
hese
codepaths are basically no-ops by now. That being said glibc needs to be
backward compatible and so will (see comment above) execute path-based fall=
back
code if the new ioctl() fails. So if you really^2 care about using TIOCGPTP=
EER
you should do the ioctl() dance yourself.

(Fwiw, I'm not directly involved with Musl I've written a patch for them as=
 well
but Rich had some reservations and I haven't been able to pick that patch b=
ack
up yet.)
