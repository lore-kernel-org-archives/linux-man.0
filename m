I agree with you that that second paragraph is a bit broken. But, like =
Heinrich,
I'm confused by this term "32-bit ... address".

I've rewritten the paragraph as:

       A futex is a 32-bit value=E2=80=94referred to below as a futex w=
ord=E2=80=94whose
       address is supplied to the futex()  system  call.   (Futexes  ar=
e
       32-bits in size on all platforms, including 64-bit systems.)  Al=
l
       futex operations are governed by this value.  In order to share =
a
       futex  between  processes,  the  futex  is  placed in a region o=
f
       shared memory, created using (for example) mmap(2)  or  shmat(2)=
=2E
       (Thus the futex word may have different virtual addresses in dif=
=E2=80=90
       ferent processes, but these addresses all refer to the same loca=
=E2=80=90
       tion in physical memory.)

Maybe you still have some further improvements for the paragraph?

Cheers,

Michael
