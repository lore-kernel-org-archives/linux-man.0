In a commit message, you note:

"On systems that do not support
protection keys, it still works, but requires that key=0."

I think this could be added in NOTES.

Actually, the above paragraph doesn't explain what pkey_free() does.
That explanation should, I think, be in a separate paragraph below
the description of 'flags'.

At the start of the following paragraph, add

.(RB pkey_alloc ())

so that the reader knows that this error applies only for that syscall.

Here, there should be a VERSIONS section noting the Linux kernel
version where these system calls appeared and a CONFORMING TO
section noting that these system calls are Linux-specific.

Rewrite the preceding paragraph as

===
.BR pkey_set ()
sets the current set of rights for the calling
thread for the protection key specified by
.IR pkey .
When rights for a key are disabled, any future access
to any memory region with that key set will generate a
.B SIGSEGV
signal.
Access rights are private to each thread.
.PP
.I access_rights
may contain zero or more disable operations:
.TP
.B PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
Disable all access to memory protected by the specified protection key.
.TP
.B PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
Disable write access to memory protected by the specified protection key.

The
.pkey_get ()
system call returns the current set of rights assigned for the protection key,
.IR pkey .
===

The next three paragraphs should I think be moved to a NOTES section
lower in the page.

In a previous review of the pages, I asked:

[[
And I have a question (and the answer probably should 
be documented in the manual page).  What happens when 
one signal handler interrupts the execution of another? 
Do pkey_set() calls in the first handler persist into the 
second handler? I presume not, but it would be good to 
be a little more explicit about this.
]]

I think this point does need to be covered in the man page.

The above paragraph should be moved up. See my rewrite above.

Make that last line:

.I pkey
or
.I access_rights
is invalid.


Here, there should be a VERSIONS section noting the Linux kernel
version where these system calls appeared and a CONFORMING TO
section noting that these system calls are Linux-specific.

So, pi_key needs to be added to the structure definition shown earlier in

Is there a recommended way for an application to discover whether the
system supports pkeys? If so, that should be documented here.

The above piece should be done as a patch to the 'smaps'
entry in proc(5).

The detail about smaps should also be in the patch to proc(5).

Would it be possible to get a small, complete working example program
in one of these pages? The axample could show how pkeys override
traditional memory protections. I appreciate that the rest of us do
not yet have suitable hardware, but presumably you do.

Cheers,

Michael
