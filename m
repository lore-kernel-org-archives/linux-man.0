I've used LTP in the past (quite a bit), and I felt there was some
advantage to keeping futextest independent. Perhaps things have changed
enough since then (~2009 era) that we should reconsider. We can discuss
the pros/cons there if you like. I have agreed to move the performance
related tests over to perf, and Davidlohr has added some other such tests
to perf. Trinity now covers the planned fuzz testing for futexes (very
well... Obviously) so that idea will be dropped, leaving pure functional
tests in futextest.
