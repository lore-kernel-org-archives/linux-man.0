Here are some minor-ish benefits:

 - It avoids having a code path that is only used with 32 bit code on
64 bit kernels and is therefore rarely tested.  (In this particular
case, the code path doesn't diverge much, but for most compat
syscalls, it's almost an entirely separate implementation of the main
syscall code.)

 - It makes life easier for tools like strace.

 - It minimizes the chance of making a giant mess on x32, which isn't
really native or compat.
