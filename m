Should we make this state more accessible, by providing a different
error code?

Will the system call ever return ESRCH, given that you have a handle for
the process?

I meant on top of the existing interface.

Do you want to land all this in one kernel release?  I wonder how
applications are supposed to discover kernel support if functionality is
split across several kernel releases.  If you get EINVAL or EBADF, it
may not be obvious what is going on.

What happens if you use the new interface with an O_PATH descriptor?

Thanks,
