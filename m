I guess the point here is that it really makes no sense not to
change ownership of cgroup.procs. On the other hand, if
ownership of cgroup.subtree_control is not handed to the
delegatee, then the delegater can choose which controllers the
delegatee will be allowed to exercise, by writing only those
controllers into cgroup.subtree_control. I'm not sure if
there's a use case though.

Okay. For the moment, I'll leave that text as is.

I realized that there was also one more file that needs to be included
in the list of files that must be delegated:

       /dlgt_grp/cgroup.threads
              Changing the ownership of  this  file  is  necessary  if  a
              threaded subtree is being delegated (see the description of
              "thread mode", below).

Can you please confirm that it's only necessary to delegate this file
if we are delegating a threaded subtree?

Okay. (Except I may not not e when you forget ;-).)

Thanks for checking the text, Tejun!
