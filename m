Frankly, I don't see a good argument for why we would allow that even if
safe. I have not heard a legitimate use-case or need for this.
At this point I care about very simple semantics. Being able to signal
into ancestor pid namespaces and cousin namespaces is interesting but
makes the syscall more brittle and harder to understand.
Changing pid_nr_ns() might be the solution but this function is called
all over the place in the kernel and I'm not going to risk breaking
something by changing it for a feature that no one so far has ever
asked for.
If you are ok with this then we should hold off on this. We can always
add this feature later by removing the check when someone has a use-case
for it.
I'll send a v2 of the patch that keeps the restriction for now. If you
insist on it being removed we can make the change in a follow-up
iteration.
