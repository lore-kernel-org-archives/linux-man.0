It's equally wrong for normal futexes. And its actually the same code
checking for this for all variants.

It's actually EDEADLK

Oops. My bad. That's not the what the kernel does. The kernel merily
marks it in the futex itself with FUTEX_OWNER_DIED. User space needs
to deal with that and the posix users return EOWNERDEAD (not
EOWNERDIED], so it's not part of the futex call itself.

We had discussions about returning EOWNERDEAD in that case, but then
glibc with its sophisticated error handling prevented that ....

Indeed. That's just wrong.

Care to send a patch?

Right. We dont support that bitset stuff in requeue_pi ATM.
