Fair enough.

I'm reasonably sure that lockdown is not intended to be this far
reaching.  cap_net_admin can see traffic coming into the host, and I
don't think lockdown is intended to change that.

David, I think this is exactly why you need to define what "lockdown"
means.  As it stands, the best argument I've seen involves
"blacklisting", but that's a political thing and almost no one
involved has any ability to evaluate it.  Right now there's a series
of patches that check for "lockdown" and seem to disable things that
make someone uncomfortable.  That's not a good way to design a
security feature.
