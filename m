Indeed, although, in hindsight, they should have had the same numbers.

Yes.

I would propose that it should be 335 | 0x40000000.  I can't see any
reasonable way to teach the kernel to reject 335 | 0x40000000 that
wouldn't work just as well to accept it and make it do the right
thing.  Currently we accept it and do the *wrong* thing, which is no
good.

There's nothing particularly novel about this.  seccomp(), for
example, already works like this.

What hack are you referring to here?

True :)
