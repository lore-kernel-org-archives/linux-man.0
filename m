Looks like the manpage should be fine, as it wasn't very specific wrt these
madvise flags. The only thing that potentially applies is:

"EINVAL advice is not a valid."

which itself looks like it needs fixing. Valid what, value? As in completely
unknown flags, or flags not valid for the given vma?

Anyway, I agree that it doesn't make sense to fail madvise when the given flag
is already set. On the other hand, I don't think the userspace app should fail
just because of madvise failing? It should in general be an advice that the
kernel is also strictly speaking free to ignore as it shouldn't affect
correctnes, just performance. Yeah, there are exceptions today like
MADV_DONTNEED, but that shouldn't apply to hugepages?
So I think Qemu needs fixing too. Also what happens if the kernel is build
without CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE? Then madvise also returns EINVAL, how does
Qemu handle that?
