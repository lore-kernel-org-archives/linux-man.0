Hello Darren,

I give you the same apology as to Thomas for the 
long-delayed response to your mail.

And I repeat my note to Thomas:
In the next day or two, I hope to send out the new version
of the futex(2) page for review. The new draft is a bit
bigger (okay -- 4 x bigger) than the current page. And there 
are a quite number of FIXMEs that I've placed in the page 
for various points--some minor, but a few major--that need
to be checked or fixed. Would you have some time to review
that page? 

In the meantime, I have a couple of questions, which, if 
you could answer them, I would work some changes into the 
page before sending.

1. In various places, distinction is made between non-PI 
   futexs and PI futexes. But what determines that distinction?
   From the kernel's perspective, hat make a futex one type
   or another? I presume it is to do with the types of blocking
   waiters on the futex, but it would be good to have a formal
   definition.

2. Can you say something about the pairing requirements of
   FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI and FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI. 
   What is the requirement and why do we need it?

Most of the rest of this mail is just a checklist noting
what I did with your comments. No response is needed 
in most cases, but there is one that I have marked with
"???". If you could reply to that. I'd be grateful.

Yes, that would be good.

??? Great text. May I presume that I can take this text 
and freely adapt it for the man page? (Actually, this is a 
request for forgiveness, rather than permission :-).)

Thanks for that text. It is easier to grasp.

I added the piece about "thundering herd".

Yes. (The text now says that 'val3' has the same purpose as 
for FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE.)

Thanks. I added that detail.

Thanks. Added.

I think the page probably needs some text to cover that point. I'll add
a FIXME for review.

Thanks.

Thanks, I'd already spotted this, but it's good to have confirmation.

Yes. And I've followed that convention now in the man page.

Any further insight on the above?

Yes. Already noted.
