Fair enough. I added some vague text about resources needing to be freed
before the cgroup is destroyed. See below.

Okay, I added some text along those lines. The first paragraph now reads:

       nr_dying_descendants
              This is the total number  of  dying  descendant  cgroups
              underneath this cgroup.  A cgroup enters the dying state
              after being deleted.  It remains in that  state  for  an
              undefined  period  (which  will  depend  on system load)
              while  resources  are  freed  before   the   cgroup   is
              destroyed.   Note  that  the presence of some cgroups in
              the dying state is normal, and is not indicative of  any
              problem.

Thanks,

Michael
