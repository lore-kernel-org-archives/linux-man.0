I agree that it is a little surprising to add kernel-internal
constants in a man page. (There are precedents, but they are few.)
But see my reply to Kees. It's more than just explaining low level
details: there are various kinds of user-space behavior differences
(real vs filesystem credentials; permitted vs effective capabilities)
produced by the ptrace_may_access() checks, and those behaviors need
to be described and *somehow* labeled for cross-referencing from
other man pages.

Good point. I changed "may" to "are". ("must" is not quite right to my
"user-space" ear; it might be misread as implying that the user-space
developer must do something.)

Can you be a little more precise about "here", and maybe tell me why
you think it helps?

As we can see, I am one of those who are unaware of how the LSM API
works :-/.

No, that's a terminological confusion of my own making. Fixed now.

I changed this text to:

        Various parts of the kernel-user-space API (not just  ptrace(2)
        operations), require so-called "ptrace access mode permissions"
        which are gated by any enabled Linux Security Module (LSMs)=E2=80=
=94for
        example,  SELinux,  Yama, or Smack=E2=80=94and by the the commo=
ncap LSM
        (which is always invoked).  Prior to  Linux  2.6.27,  all  such
        checks  were  of a single type.  Since Linux 2.6.27, two access
        mode levels are distinguished:

BTW, can you point me at the piece(s) of kernel code that show that
"commoncap" is always invoked in addition to any other LSM that has
been installed?
