This should be:

"statx() uses pathname, dirfd, and  flags  *to* identify  the  target"

Since we write "Linux-specific" further above we should probably use

"very much filesystem-specific."

here for consistency.

We should probably either insert a colon here

"Note: the kernel does not reject values in mask other  than  the..."

or reformulate the sentence like this.

"Note that the kernel does not reject values in mask other  than  the..."

This group ID is the gid of the file owner's primary group, no? At least
that's what the field comment in the DESCRIPTION implies.

I think it would be more accurate to write:

"The ID of the file owner's primary group"

We write out 'filesystem' everywhere else so I think we should replace 'fs'
with it here as well.

For consistency we should write:

"statx() is Linux-specific".


I wrote the changes in-line but if you prefer I can 'git send-email'
a patch as well.


Cheers and thanks for all the hard work!
