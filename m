Yes. The LSM infrastructure is "bail on fail".

All registered modules are invoked, but only one "major"
module can be registered. The "minor" modules show up in
security_init, while the majors come in via do_security_initcalls.

I am in the process of messing that all up with patches
allowing multiple major modules. Stay tuned.
