We certainly have introduced orthogonal APIs in various areas before,
such that applications written prior to those APIs may interact
interestingly with them; we don't allow *breaking* those applications,
or introducing security holes, but the existence of applications
designed to block one particular way to do something doesn't
*automatically* rule out the possibility of adding another way to do it.
It does require some careful thought, though.

When we introduced seccomp filters for syscalls, we tied them to
no_new_privs to prevent any possible security holes caused by selective
syscall denial/filtration.

In this case, I'm indifferent about whether unprivileged setgroups works
without no_new_privs; if people are comfortable with that, fine, and if
people would prefer no_new_privs (or for that matter a sysctl, a
compile-time option, or any other means of making the behavior
optional), I can do that too.  The security model of "having a group
gives you less privilege than not having it" seems crazy, but
nonetheless I can see a couple of easy ways that we can avoid breaking
that pattern, no_new_privs being one of them.  I'd like to make sure
that nobody sees any other real-world corner case that unprivileged
setgroups would break.
