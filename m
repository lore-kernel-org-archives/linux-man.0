No, I missed that. Thanks for pointing out. The manpage also explains EINVAL in
this case:

*  The application is attempting to release locked or shared pages (with
MADV_DONTNEED).

- that covers mlocking ok, not sure if the rest fits the "shared pages" case
though. I dont see any check for other kinds of shared pages in the code.

Right, so as long as they check for EINVAL, it should be safe. It appears that
jemalloc does.

I still wouldnt be sure just by reading the man page that the clearing is
guaranteed whenever I dont get an error return value, though,
