IMHO,

Man page said
"MADV_DONTNEED: Subsequent accesses of pages in this range will succeed,
 but will result either in reloading of  the memory contents from the
 underlying mapped file (see mmap(2)) or  zero-fill-on-demand pages
 for mappings without an underlying file."

Heap by allocated by malloc(3) is anonymous page so it's a mapping
withtout an underlying file so userspace can expect zero-fill.

Man page said
"EINVAL: The application is attempting to release locked or
shared pages (with MADV_DONTNEED)"

So, user can expect the call on area by allocated by malloc(3)
if he doesn't call mlock will always be successful.

Man page said
"madivse: This call does not influence the semantics of the application
(except in the case of MADV_DONTNEED)"

So, we shouldn't break MADV_DONTNEED's semantic which free pages
instantly. It's a long time semantic and it was one of arguable issues
on MADV_FREE Rik had tried long time ago to replace MADV_DONTNEED
with MADV_FREE.
