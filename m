>From my perspective, a named interface with specific documented interfaces
is far more usable than a vargs direct syscall. That just leaves all kinds
of room for error - which of course is why we all write our own wrappers
in our apps rather than use it directly... If we all do it, it seems to me
that is a strong indicator we should provide it in some kind of common
library. Maybe that's libc... Maybe that's libnix...
