So clearly, I misunderstood these last two steps.

(7) is something like: discover information in userspace
as required; perform userspace actions if appropriate
(perhaps doing the system call operation "on behalf of" the
target process).


(8) is something like:
   set 'error' and 'val' to return info to the target process:
    * error != 0 ==> make it look like the syscall failed,
      with 'errno' set to that value
    * error == 0 ==> make it look like the syscall succeeded 
      and returned 'val'

Right?

Cheers,

Michael
