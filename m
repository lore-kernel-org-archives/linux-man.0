Hi Jann, Stephen, et al.

Jann, since you recently committed a patch in this area, and Stephen,
since you committed 006ebb40d3d much further back in time, I wonder if
you might help me by reviewing the text below that I propose to add to
the ptrace(2) man page, in order to document "ptrace access mode=20
checking" that is performed in various parts of the kernel-user-space
interface. Of course, I welcome input from anyone else as well.

Here's the new ptrace(2) text. Any comments, technical or terminologica=
l
fixes, other improvements, etc. are welcome.

[[
   Ptrace access mode checking
       Various parts of the kernel-user-space API (not just  ptrace(2)
       operations), require so-called "ptrace access mode permissions"
       which are gated  by  Linux  Security  Modules  (LSMs)  such  as
       SELinux,  Yama,  Smack,  or  the  default  LSM.  Prior to Linux
       2.6.27, all such checks were of a  single  type.   Since  Linux
       2.6.27, two access mode levels are distinguished:

       PTRACE_MODE_READ
              For  "read" operations or other operations that are less
              dangerous, such as: get_robust_list(2); kcmp(2); reading
              /proc/[pid]/auxv,         /proc/[pid]/environ,        or
              /proc/[pid]/stat; or readlink(2) of  a  /proc/[pid]/ns/*
              file.

       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH
              For  "write"  operations,  or  other operations that are
              more    dangerous,    such    as:    ptrace    attaching
              (PTRACE_ATTACH)    to   another   process   or   calling
              process_vm_writev(2).   (PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH  was  effec=E2=
=80=90
              tively the default before Linux 2.6.27.)

       Since  Linux  4.5, the above access mode checks may be combined
       (ORed) with one of the following modifiers:

       PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS
              Use the caller's filesystem UID  and  GID  (see  creden=E2=
=80=90
              tials(7)) or effective capabilities for LSM checks.

       PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS
              Use the caller's real UID and GID or permitted capabili=E2=
=80=90
              ties for LSM checks.  This was effectively  the  default
              before Linux 4.5.

       Because  combining  one of the credential modifiers with one of
       the aforementioned access modes is  typical,  some  macros  are
       defined in the kernel sources for the combinations:

       PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_READ | PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS.

       PTRACE_MODE_READ_REALCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_READ | PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS.

       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_FSCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH | PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS.

       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS
              Defined as PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH | PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS.

       One further modifier can be ORed with the access mode:

       PTRACE_MODE_NOAUDIT (since Linux 3.3)
              Don't audit this access mode check.

[I'd quite welcome some text to explain "auditing" here.]

       The  algorithm  employed for ptrace access mode checking deter=E2=
=80=90
       mines whether the calling process is  allowed  to  perform  the
       corresponding action on the target process, as follows:

       1.  If the calling thread and the target thread are in the same
           thread group, access is always allowed.

       2.  If the access mode specifies PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS, then  for
           the  check in the next step, employ the caller's filesystem
           user ID and group ID (see credentials(7));  otherwise  (the
           access  mode  specifies  PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS, so) use the
           caller's real user ID and group ID.

       3.  Deny access if neither of the following is true:

           =C2=B7 The real, effective, and saved-set user IDs of the ta=
rget
             match  the caller's user ID, and the real, effective, and
             saved-set group IDs of  the  target  match  the  caller's
             group ID.

           =C2=B7 The caller has the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability.

       4.  Deny  access if the target process "dumpable" attribute has
           a value other than 1 (SUID_DUMP_USER; see the discussion of
           PR_SET_DUMPABLE  in prctl(2)), and the caller does not have
           the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in the user namespace of  the
           target process.

       5.  The  kernel LSM security_ptrace_access_check() interface is
           invoked to see if ptrace access is permitted.  The  results
           depend on the LSM.  The implementation of this interface in
           the default LSM performs the following steps:

           a) If the access mode  includes  PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS,  then
              use the caller's effective capability set in the follow=E2=
=80=90
              ing  check;  otherwise  (the   access   mode   specifies
              PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS,  so)  use  the caller's permitted
              capability set.

           b) Deny access if neither of the following is true:

              =C2=B7 The caller's capabilities are a proper superset of=
 the
                target process's permitted capabilities.

              =C2=B7 The  caller  has  the CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability in=
 the
                target process's user namespace.

              Note that the default LSM does not  distinguish  between
              PTRACE_MODE_READ and PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH.

       6.  If  access  has  not  been  denied  by any of the preceding
           steps, then access is allowed.

There are accompanying changes to various pages that refer to=20
the new text in ptrace(2), so that, for example, kcmp(2) adds:

       Permission  to  employ kcmp() is governed by ptrace access mode
       PTRACE_MODE_ATTACH_REALCREDS checks against both pid1 and pid2;
       see ptrace(2).

and proc.5 has additions such as:

       /proc/[pid]/auxv (since 2.6.0-test7)
              ...
              Permission to access this file is governed by  a  ptrace
              access    mode   PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS   check;   see
              ptrace(2).

       /proc/[pid]/cwd
              ...
              Permission to dereference  or  read  (readlink(2))  this
              symbolic  link  is  governed  by  a  ptrace  access mode
              PTRACE_MODE_READ_FSCREDS check; see ptrace(2).

Michael
