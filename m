Grr, failed to mention about SIGKILL/SIGSTOP from parent ns.
Here is an updated patch.

Subject: [PATCH] Document signal-semantics changes of container-init

Container-inits have some special signal semantics depending on
whether the sender is from an ancestor pid-namespace or from a
descendant process. These changes were implemented by the patchset:

	http://lkml.org/lkml/2009/2/18/493

Document the new semantics in the clone(2) and kill(2) man pages.

 to all processes that the calling process may send signals to,
 except possibly for some implementation-defined system processes.
