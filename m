I've forwarded Dmitry's patch to this effect.

If I choose that, I presume I would have to give EINVAL if the path is NULL or
anything other than ""?

That's fine.

Can you do footnotes in roff?

	It should be noted that  the  kernel  may  return  fields  that
	weren't  requested[*]  and  may  fail  to  return fields that were
	requested, depending on what the backing  filesystem  supports.

	[*] These can be safely ignored.

Or maybe:

	It should be noted that  the  kernel  may  return  fields  that
	weren't  requested  and  may  fail  to  return fields that were
	requested, depending on what the backing  filesystem  supports.
	Fields that are given values despite being unrequested can just
	be ignored.

The paragraph promises a "dummy value will be filled in for compatibility
purposes if one is available", but doesn't place any restriction on the fields
towhich this applies.  This is only true of the basic stat fields; all other
fields will be cleared if not set.

Maybe we can just leave this as is.  We're not promising a dummy field will
*always* be emplaced.  We can always say that they're just not available for
extended fields if someone asks.

Maybe the best thing to do is to simply add "and cleared otherwise." to the
end of the paragraph.

Sounds good.

It's not so obvious with the bits that are currently defined.  But I have a
patch that adds Windows attribute bits also (for cifs, ntfs, fat, ...).  What
does it mean, say, if the archive bit is clear?  Does it mean that archive
isn't set in the fs or that the fs doesn't support it?

Further, I have plans to add a 'setattrx' syscall that takes a statx struct
and calls notify_change() with its contents in the kernel.  If I do that, I
need to indicate to notify_change() what changes should be effected.  stx_mask
covers most of the fields, but not stx_attributes.  Some of these attributes
would be alterable.

Would you prefer it to be reverted for the moment?
