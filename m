True.

But there is still the problem for the ltp syscall test "readlink03", w=
hen=20
using the glibc "readlink" interface, by calling readlink with a buffer=
 size=20
of "-1".

Calling "-1" seems to be a valid code/error-path in the linux syscall=20
"readlink", since there is a check for less-equal zero.

But the less zero, condition can't be reached via the glibc "readlink"=20
interface since this would cause fortify-check to fail (when buliding w=
ith -
D_FORITFY_SOURCE=3D2).

To "workaround" the fortify check, by not compiling the testcase with -
D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=3D2, or trying to test the linux readlink interface by=
 calling=20
directly syscall() in the testcase ... both suggestion are just workaro=
unds -=20
no real solutions.

We could also just remove the testcase of buffer size "-1".

The problem is still, how to test the "readlink" syscall in LTP?

best regards,
Daniel
