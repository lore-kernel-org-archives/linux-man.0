As others have said, I'm surprised about seeing documentation about
kernel-internal constants in manpages - but I think it might be a good
thing to have there, given that people who look at ptrace(2) are likely
to be interested in low-level details.

s/may/must/; otherwise __ptrace_may_access() will yell about the kernel
code being broken and deny access.

Might want to add a "for historical reasons" or so here.

Might want to also specify here (like below) that the caller needs to
have the capability relative to the user ns of the target.

For people who are unaware of how the LSM API works, it might be good to
clarify that the commoncap LSM is *always* invoked; otherwise, it might
give the impression that using another LSM would replace it.
(Also, are there other documents that refer to it as "default LSM"? I
think that that term is slightly confusing.)

This also requires the caller and the target to be in the same user
namespace.

(Actually, kcmp() just needs READ access - you described that accurately
earlier, but it's wrong here.)

That sounds great! :)
