This history is certainly a bit odd.

mremap seems to work with non-anonymous mappings, too:

#include <err.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/* Hopefully large enough to prevent crossing of a page boundary in
    the implementation.  */
__attribute__ ((aligned (256), noclone, noinline, weak))
int
callback (void)
{
   return 17;
}

int
main (void)
{
   long pagesize = sysconf (_SC_PAGESIZE);
   if (pagesize < 0)
     err (1, "sysconf");
   uintptr_t addr = (uintptr_t) &callback;
   addr = addr / pagesize * pagesize;
   printf ("old function address: %p\n", &callback);
   ptrdiff_t page_offset = (uintptr_t) &callback - addr;
   void *newaddr = mremap ((void *) addr, 0, pagesize, MREMAP_MAYMOVE);
   if (newaddr == MAP_FAILED)
     err (1, "mremap");
   if (memcmp ((void *) addr, newaddr, pagesize) != 0)
     errx (1, "page contents differs");
   int (*newfunc) (void) = newaddr + page_offset;
   printf ("new function address: %p\n", newfunc);
   if (newfunc () != 17)
     errx (1, "invalid return value from newfunc");
   if (callback () != 17)
     errx (1, "invalid return value from callback");
   return 0;
}

(The code needs adjustment for architectures where function pointers 
point to a descriptor and not the actual code.)

This looks very useful for generating arbitrary callback wrappers 
without actual run-time code generation.  memfd_create would not work 
for that.

To my knowledge, we do not use this today.  But it certainly looks very 
useful.

Thanks,
