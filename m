statx, not renameat2.

The following needs to be added in here:

		__u64	stx_attributes_mask; /* Mask to show what's supported in stx_attributes */

This indicates what stx_attributes the VFS and filesystem actually support.

If you're going to do Dmitry's suggestion, then this needs to be __u32 and you
should remove "before or".

I think this is too wordy for a heading and it almost seems to merge into the
description paragraph since it almost ends at the same right margin.  How
about:

	A directory-relative pathname

AT_EMPTY_PATH wasn't there back in 2010.  I could eliminate the:

	statx(fd, NULL, 0, ...);

option in favour of:

	statx(fd, "", AT_EMPTY_PATH, ...);

Any thoughts either way, Al?

It would seem that AT_EMPTY_PATH should be redundant, though, since you can
just set the pathname pointer to NULL.

Is it worth mentioning STATX__RESERVED here, I wonder?  It's not something
that you can actually use (you'll get EINVAL if you try), and will be renamed
should it become used.

Maybe add "and can be safely ignored" in there somewhere since this seems to
be upsetting people.

I don't promise a dummy value for any "extended" field other than zero.

Should this list either be in alphabetical order or offset-in-struct order?

This needs to be added:

	stx_attributes_mask
	      A mask indicating which bits in stx_attributes are supported by
	      the VFS and the filesystem.

Probably should mention stx_attributes_mask here also.  Perhaps:

       The stx_attributes field contains a set of ORed flags that
       indicate additional attributes of the file.  Note that any
       attribute that is not indicated as supported by
       stx_attributes_mask has no usable value here.  The bits in
       stx_attributes_mask correspond bit-by-bit to stx_attributes.
