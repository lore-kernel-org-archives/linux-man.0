It allows for error checking that the recipient of a signal is still
running.  It's obviously not reliable, but I think it could be helpful
in the context of closely cooperating processes.

I see, thanks.

I suppose that's fine.  Or alternatively, when thread group support is
added, introduce a flag that applications have to use to enable it, so
that they can probe for support by checking support for the flag.

I wouldn't be opposed to a new system call like this either:

  int procfd_open (pid_t thread_group, pid_t thread_id, unsigned flags);

But I think this is frowned upon on the kernel side.

Yes, that's quite reasonable.  Thanks.
