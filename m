But this implementation is quite wrong.  It has to look like something
like this:

int
getentropy (void *buf, size_t buflen)
{
  ssize_t ret = getrandom (buf, buflen, 0)
  if (ret < 0)
    return -1;
  if (ret < buflen)
    {
      errno = EIO;
      return -1;
    }
  return 0;
}

The ssize_t return would hint to the fact that such a wrapper is
required because the interfaces are somewhat different.

Right, that's true for the Linux implementation.  The question is
whether it applies to other implementations as well.  Solaris appears
to have an even lower limit.
