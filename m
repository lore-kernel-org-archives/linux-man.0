If this is purely about getting a procfd then I think this isn't really
necessary since you can get it from /proc/<pid> and
/proc/<pid>/task/<tid> so a syscall just for that is likely overkill.
However, I started to pick up the CLONE_FD patchset but ideally I would
like it to be way simpler to what was proposed back in the day (which is
not a critique, I just don't feel comfortable with bringing massive
patches to the table that I can barely judge wrt to their correctness.
:)). I have toyed around with this a little and I'm tempted to simply
have the syscall always return an fd for the process and not require a
separate flag for this. But I need to work through the details and this
is really far out into the (kernel) future.
