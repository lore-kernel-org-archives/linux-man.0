+.TH PKEY_GET 2 2016-03-03 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+pkey_get, pkey_set \- manage protection key access permissions
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.nf
+.B #include <sys/mman.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int pkey_get(int " pkey ", unsigned long " flags ");
+.BI "int pkey_set(int " pkey ", unsigned long " access_rights ", unsigned long " flags ");"
+.fi
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.BR pkey_set ()
+sets the current set of rights for the calling
+thread for the protection key specified by
+.IR pkey .
+When rights for a key are disabled, any future access
+to any memory region with that key set will generate a
+.B SIGSEGV
+signal.
+Access rights are private to each thread.
+.PP
+.I access_rights
+may contain zero or more disable operations:
+.TP
+.B PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
+Disable all access to memory protected by the specified protection key.
+.TP
+.B PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
+Disable write access to memory protected by the specified protection key.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On success,
+.BR pkey_set ()
+returns zero.
+.BR pkey_get ()
+returns a mask containing zero or more of the disable operations
+listed above.
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set appropriately.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+.I pkey
+or
+.I access_rights
+is invalid.
+.SH NOTES
+When any signal handler is invoked, the thread is temporarily
+given a new, default set of protection key rights that override
+whatever rights were set in the interrupted context.
+The thread's protection key rights are restored when the signal
+handler returns.
+
+The effects of a call to
+.BR pkey_set ()
+from a signal handler will not persist when control passes out of
+the signal handler.
+This is true both when the handler returns to a normal,
+nonsignal context, and when the signal handler is interrupted
+by another signal handler.
+
+This signal behavior is unusual and is due to the fact that
+the x86 PKRU register (which stores \fIaccess_rights\fP)
+is managed with the same hardware mechanism (XSAVE) that
+manages
+floating-point registers.
+The signal behavior is the same as that of a floating point
+register.
+.SH VERSIONS
+.BR pkey_get ()
+and
+.BR pkey_set ()
+were added to Linux in kernel <FIXME>;
+library support was added to glibc in version <FIXME>.
+.SH CONFORMING TO
+The
+.BR pkey_get ()
+and
+.BR pkey_set ()
+system calls are Linux-specific.
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.BR pkey_alloc (2),
+.BR pkey_free (2),
+.BR pkey_mprotect (2),
+.BR pkey (7),
