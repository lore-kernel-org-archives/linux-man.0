Thanks, Darrick. Applied.

I sees there's also some small problems with the page licenses in these
two new pages: the markup "VERBATIM" is wrong. And you don't mention 
the GPL version.

Can I suggest either changing the license to the real "verbatim" 
license (https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/licenses.html#verbatim),
or to a GPL with version (see 
https://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/licenses.html#gpl

Cheers,

Michael
