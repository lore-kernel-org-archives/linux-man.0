I fully agree with Michael here.

The futex() syscall was never exposed to userspace specifically because
it was an interface we did not want to support forever with a stable ABI.
The futex() syscall is an implementation detail that is shared between
the kernel and the writers of core runtimes for Linux.

The fact that the futex() syscall is out of date is my fault, is the fault
of Linux kernel developers, etc. etc., we should all have reached out to
Michael with patches to keep this developer-centric documentation updated.

Agreed. The man page should get expanded and should be as detailed as possible
about the interface the kernel is exposing.

There are other syscalls like gettid() that have a:
NOTE: There is no glibc wrapper for this system call; see NOTES.

That's what should happen here with futex() (though NOTES does mention this,
but it's not called out at the top of the man page).

Cheers,
Carlos.
