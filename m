+.TH PKEY_ALLOC 2 2016-03-03 "Linux" "Linux Programmer's Manual"
+.SH NAME
+pkey_alloc, pkey_free \- allocate or free a protection key
+.SH SYNOPSIS
+.nf
+.B #include <sys/mman.h>
+.sp
+.BI "int pkey_alloc(unsigned long " flags ", unsigned long " access_rights ");"
+.BI "int pkey_free(int " pkey ");"
+.fi
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.BR pkey_alloc ()
+allocates a protection key and allows it to be passed to
+the other interfaces that accept a protection key like
+.BR pkey_mprotect (),
+.BR pkey_set ()
+and
+.BR pkey_get ().
+.PP
+.BR pkey_free ()
+frees a protection key and makes it available for later
+allocations.
+After a protection key has been freed, it may no longer be used
+in any protection-key-related operations.
+An application should not call
+.BR pkey_free ()
+on any protection key which has been assigned to an address
+range by
+.BR pkey_mprotect ()
+and which is still in use.  The behavior in this case is
+undefined and may result in an error.
+.PP
+.RB ( pkey_alloc ())
+.I flags
+may contain zero or more disable operations:
+.TP
+.B PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
+Disable all data access to memory covered by the returned protection key.
+.TP
+.B PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
+Disable write access to memory covered by the returned protection key.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On success,
+.BR pkey_alloc ()
+returns a positive protection key value.
+.BR pkey_free ()
+returns zero.
+On error, \-1 is returned, and
+.I errno
+is set appropriately.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+.IR pkey ,
+.IR flags ,
+or
+.I access_rights
+is invalid.
+.TP
+.B ENOSPC
+.(RB pkey_alloc ())
+All protection keys available for the current process have
+been allocated.
+The number of keys available is architecture-specific and
+implementation-specfic and may be reduced by kernel-internal use
+of certain keys.
+There are currently 15 keys available to user programs on x86.
+.SH VERSIONS
+.BR pkey_alloc ()
+and
+.BR pkey_free ()
+were added to Linux in kernel <FIXME>;
+library support was added to glibc in version <FIXME>.
+.SH CONFORMING TO
+The
+.BR pkey_alloc ()
+and
+.BR pkey_free ()
+system calls are Linux-specific.
+.SH
+.SH SEE ALSO
+.BR pkey_get (2),
+.BR pkey_mprotect (2),
+.BR pkey_set (2),
+.BR pkey (7)
