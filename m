From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen-VuQAYsv1563Yd54FQh9/CA@public.gmane.org>

The signal behavior of pkeys is special compared to many other
processor and OS features.  Add a special section to describe
the behavior.

This was previously a part of the pkey_get manpage, but that
page was removed from my submission when we removed the
syscall itself.  I've essentially moved the content from that
page to the main pkey.7 page.

+.SS Signal Handler Behavior
+Each time a signal handler is invoked (including nested signals), the
+thread is temporarily given a new, default set of protection key rights
+that override the rights from the interrupted context.
+This means that applications must re-establish their desired protection
+key rights upon entering a signal handler if the desired rights differ
+from the defaults.
+The rights of any interrupted context are restored when the signal
+handler returns.
+
+This signal behavior is unusual and is due to the fact that the x86 PKRU
+register (which stores protection key access rights) is managed with the
+same hardware mechanism (XSAVE) that manages floating-point registers.
+The signal behavior is the same as that of floating point registers.
