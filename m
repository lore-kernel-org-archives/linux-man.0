=46UTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI can return -EINVAL if called with invalid param=
eters, such
as uaddr=3D=3Duaddr2, or (in the case of SHARED futexes), the associate=
d keys match
(meaning it's the same futex word - shared memory, inode, etc.). This c=
an't
happen if the stated policy of requeueing from non-pi to pi is followed=
 as the
same word cannot be both non-pi and pi at the same time, requiring them=
 to be
unique futex words.

=46UTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI will fail similarly if uaddr and uaddr2 are the =
same futex
word. Also, if nr_wake !=3D 1.

But, to the point I was making above, FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI must reque u=
addr to
same uaddr2 specified in the previous FUTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI call.
=46UTEX_WAIT_REQUEUE_PI sets up the operation, FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE_PI com=
pletes it,
and they must agree on uaddr and uaddr2.

Agreed.

Arg, lost context. Which question?

In my humble opinion, the paragraph about RT-mutex above should perhaps=
 instead
read something like:


	    In  the  cases  where  callers  are forced into the kernel (i.e.,
	    required to perform a futex() call), they then deal directly with
	    Linux kernel internal mechanisms which implement the required
	    priority-inheritance semantics.  Once the internal locking structu=
re
	    is  acquired,  the futex value is updated accordingly, before the
	    calling thread returns to user space.

I'm not terribly particular about this, but in my opinion, we should no=
t refer
to internal-only kernel structures in the man page. Feel free to ignore=
, or to
defer to a differing opinion from Thomas or others.

Thanks for all your work on this!
