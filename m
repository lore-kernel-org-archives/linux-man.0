Hm, basically any cgroup which had some pagecache, associated during the
lifetime, will spend some time in the dying state. This means that for
most cgroups this number will be non-zero for some amount of time,
which depends on global memory pressure.
It's also very implementation-defined, and will be likely changed
in the following kernel versions.

So, I'm not sure, that such an example will be useful for a user.
Until this number is huge and constantly growing, it shouldn't be
interesting for an user at all.

So, maybe it worth it to add a statement, that some amount of dying cgroups
is normal and it's not a signal of any problem?

Otherwise looks very good to me.

Thank you!
