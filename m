The LSM isn't really the one-size-fits-all solution that distributions
like to ship in their standard kernels...

I didn't choose user namespaces as my enemy, I chose user namespaces as
the feature that I would really like to have shipped by default by my
and by other distributions, but that's sadly often disabled for security
concerns. Is there any solution that can be safely used by distributions
to have user namespaces enabled by default without worrying about security?

Sure, it's exaggregated, but still, if it's possible to reduce the
attack surface for every user without great effort, why shouldn't that
be done?

To give an example more closely resembling the matter in hand:
CAP_SYSLOG allows viewing kernel addresses when kptr_restrict is
enabled. But why limit access to the kernel symbols? There is nothing an
attacker can do with them, except there is a kernel bug.

But before we continue arguing endlessly, I just got an idea: What about
adding a sysctl to enable/disable enforcement of the hypothetical
CAP_SYS_USER_NS, just like with /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict and
CAP_SYSLOG? Would also prevent any potential userspace breakage.

And there's the problem: It's either 100% (unpriviledged user namespaces
without limit) or 0% (disable user namespaces entirely).
