From: Dave Hansen <dave.hansen-VuQAYsv1563Yd54FQh9/CA@public.gmane.org>

Memory Protection Keys for User pages is an Intel CPU feature
which will first appear on Skylake Servers, but will also be
supported on future non-server parts (there is also a QEMU
implementation).  It provides a mechanism for enforcing
page-based protections, but without requiring modification of the
page tables when an application wishes to change permissions.

I have propsed adding five new system calls to support this feature.
The five calls are distributed across three man-pages (one existing
and 2 new), plus a new pkey(7) page which serves as a general
overview of the feature.

The system calls for this feature are not currently upstream but
can be found here:

+.fi
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+.BR pkey_set ()
+sets the current set of rights for the calling
+thread for the protection key specified by
+.IR pkey .
+When rights for a key are disabled, any future access
+to any memory region with that key set will generate a

+.B PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
+Disable all access to memory protected by the specified protection key.
+.TP
+.B PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
+Disable write access to memory protected by the specified protection key.
+.SH RETURN VALUE
+On success,

+returns zero.

+is set appropriately.
+.SH ERRORS
+.TP
+.B EINVAL
+.I pkey
+or
+.I access_rights
+is invalid.
+.SH NOTES
+When any signal handler is invoked, the thread is temporarily
+given a new, default set of protection key rights that override
+whatever rights were set in the interrupted context.  The
+thread's protection key rights are restored when the signal
+handler returns.
+
+The effects of a call to
+.BR pkey_set ()
+from a signal handler will not persist when control passes out of
+the signal handler.
+This is true both when the handler returns to a normal,
+nonsignal context, and when the signal handler is interrupted
+by another signal handler.
+
+This signal behavior is unusual and is due to the fact that
+the x86 PKRU register (which stores \fIaccess_rights\fP)
+is managed with the same hardware mechanism (XSAVE) that
+manages floating point registers.  The signal behavior is
+the same as that of a floating point register.

+.SH NAME
+pkeys \- overview of Memory Protection Keys
+.SH DESCRIPTION
+
+Memory Protection Keys (pkeys) are an extension to existing
+page-based memory permissions.  Normal page permissions using
+page tables require expensive system calls and TLB invalidations
+when changing permissions.  Memory Protection Keys provide a
+mechanism for changing protections without requiring modification
+of the page tables on every permission change.
+
+To use pkeys, software must first "tag" a page in the pagetables
+with a pkey.  After this tag is in place, an application only has
+to change the contents of a register in order to remove write
+access, or all access to a tagged page.
+
+pkeys work in conjunction with the existing PROT_READ / PROT_WRITE /
+PROT_EXEC permissions passed to system calls like
+.BR mprotect (2)
+and
+.BR mmap (2),
+but always act to further restrict these traditional permission
+mechanisms.
+
+To use this feature, the processor must support it, and Linux
+must contain support for the feature on a given processor.  As of
+early 2016 only future Intel x86 processors are supported, and this
+hardware supports 16 protection keys in each process.  However,
+pkey 0 is used as the default key, so a maximum of 15 are available
+for actual application use.
+
+Any application wanting to use protection keys needs to be able
+to function without them.  They might be unavailable because the
+hardware that the application runs on does not support them, the
+kernel code does not contain support, the kernel support has been
+disabled, or because the keys have all been allocated, perhaps by
+a library the application is using.  It is recommended that
+applications wanting to use protection keys should simply call
+.BR pkey_alloc ()
+instead of attempting to detect support for the
+feature in any other way.
+
+Hardware support for protection keys may be enumerated with
+the cpuid instruction.  Details on how to do this can be
+found in the Intel Software Developers Manual.  The kernel
+performs this enumeration and exposes the information in
+/proc/cpuinfo under the "flags" field.  "pku" in this field
+indicates hardware support for protection keys and "ospke"
+indicates that the kernel contains and has enabled protection
+keys support.
+.SS Protection Keys system calls
+The Linux kernel implements the following pkey-related system calls:
+.BR pkey_mprotect (2),
+.BR pkey_alloc (2),
+.BR pkey_free (2),
+.BR pkey_set (2),
+and
+.BR pkey_get (2) .
+.SH NOTES
+The Linux pkey system calls and are available only
+if the kernel was configured and built with the
+.BR CONFIG_X86_INTEL_MEMORY_PROTECTION_KEYS
+option.
+.SH EXAMPLE
+.PP
+The program below allocates a page of memory with read/write
+permissions via PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE.  It then writes some
+data to the memory and successfully reads it back.  After
+that, it attempts to allocate a protection key and
+disallows access to it by passsing
+.BR PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
+to
+.BR pkey_set.
+It then tried to access
+.BR buffer
+which we now expect to cause a fatal signal to the application.
