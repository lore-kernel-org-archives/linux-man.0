Just from top of my head.

Some of that is for historical reasons because the hint address used to
be ignored on some operating systems so MAP_FIXED had to be used.

Currently not user I guess but MAP_FIXED for addresses above 47b address
space AFAIR.

And I am pretty sure there would be much more if you actually browsed
code search.
