Is it the setuid/setgid or not setting up the uid/gid map?

There are weird things that happen with exec and the user namespace.  If
you have exec'd as an unmapped user all of your capabilities have
already been droped.

Almost certainly because the loginuid has already been set.  Yes. It
looks like I am simply using from_kuid instead of from_kuid_munged on
the read.  So an unmapped loginuid will be reported as 4294967295.

For some circumstances 65534 (nobody) is definitely better in some it is
a toss up, and most of the time no one really cares.  So I have tried to
do something but in this case I don't know which was the best policy.

Essentially.  It is by design that uid 0 within a namespace be mapped to
some other uid outside the namespace, and that the permissions on writes
should use the permission needed outside of the user namespace.

Which means there are all kinds of things only uid 0 can write to, that
you can't touch in a user namespace.  Some of those things the policy
may need to be reconsidered.  A lot of those things the default policy
is good.  Regardless we are now defaulting to not letting root in a
container do risky things which is a good thing.
