there is no such helper.
It's called bpf_get_prandom_u32().
I'd also add a note that it's using its own random state and cannot be
used to infer seed of other random functions in the kernel.

probably worth adding a note to explain that all bpf programs run
with preemption disabled, so processor id is stable for the run of the program.

please add that kernel should be configured with CONFIG_NET_CLS_CGROUP=y|m
and mention Documentation/cgroup-v1/net_cls.txt
Otherwise 'network classifier' is way too generic.
I'd also mention that placing a task into net_cls controller
disables all of cgroup-bpf.

Similarly this only works if CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_CLASSID is on.

I wouldn't call it deprecated.
It's still useful when programmer wants to read large quantities of
data from the packet
