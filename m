On arm64 we support 36-bit, 39-bit, 42-bit, 47-bit, 48-bit and 52-bit user
virtual addresses, some of which also enforce a particular page size of 4k,
16k or 64k. With the exception of 52-bit, the user virtual address size is
fixed at compile time and mmap() can allocate up to the maximum address
size.

When 52-bit virtual addressing is configured, we continue to allocate up to
48 bits unless either a hint is passed to mmap() as you describe, or
CONFIG_ARM64_FORCE_52BIT=y (this is really intended as a debug option and is
hidden behind EXPERT as well as being off by default).

One thing that just occurred to me is that our ASLR code is probably pretty
weak for addresses greater than 48 bits because I don't think it was updated
when we added 52-bit support. I'll take a deeper look when I get some time.
