Yeah, so I thought about that. Your point being to combine: kill(),
tgkill() aka rt_sigqueueinfo() and rt_tg_sigqueueinfo(). If I understand
this correctly the implication is to also get file descriptors to
/proc/PID/task/TID and pass them to procfd_signal()? Can we hold of on
that one? Adding this in the future should be easily doable by simply
getting /proc/PID/task/TID file descriptors but I would like this
patchset to be as small as possible.

Yes, good idea!

I tried to strictly follow the sigqueue-based permission checks. I'm not
comfortable removing this check without signal-experts telling me that
it is safe to do.
