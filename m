...and the documentation comment in the source code didn't say
anything about the syscall having a return value; it only
described the input parameters. I would actually be surprised
if any userspace caller of this syscall checked its return value
(the libgcc cacheflush function used by gcc's clear_cache builtin
doesn't, to pick one popularly used example).

    (4) The resulting misbehaviour ("my JIT crashes occasionally and
        non-reproducibly at some point possibly some while after the
        cacheflush call") will be extremely hard to track back
        to this kernel change

My suggestion would be "treat this as a bugfix, put it into
stable kernels in the usual way (and assume distros will pick
it up if appropriate)".

That would be nice :-)
