I haven't thought much about not giving out cgroup.subtree_control
when delegating.  It's probably okay but there can be surprises -
e.g. systemd or other agent failing to init resource control because
it failed to write to subtree_control at root.

Also, given that the recommended way to delegate is now chown all
files in the /sys/kernel/cgroup/delegate file it's a bit weird to
single out subtree_control.

That said, not necessarily an objection.  I'm just not sure about it.

Sorry about having not added them before.  Will try to.  Please feel
free to scream at me if I forget.

Yeah, thanks.
