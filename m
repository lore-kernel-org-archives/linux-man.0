The problem is that this is about user-space-visible behavior, but in
order to explain that behavior at what I believe is a sufficient level
of detail (e.g., to differentiate the various types of checks that
are performed for various system calls and pseudofile accesses),
one needs (1) to discuss the MODE flag details as implemented in
the kernel, and (2) to have a shorthand way to refer to the various
cases from other pages. It's not absolutely necessary to name the
flags for (1), but using the flag names is certainly a handy
shorthand for (2).

Cheers,

Michael
