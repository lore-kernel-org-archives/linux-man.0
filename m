See the first part of Daniel's answer in [1] answer which makes sense to
me. I won't repeat it here.

Yeah, maybe you missed it in the commit message [2] which is based on a
discussion with Andy [3] and Arnd [4]:

     /* taskfd_send_signal() replaces multiple pid-based syscalls */
    The taskfd_send_signal() syscall currently takes on the job of the
    following syscalls that operate on pids:
    - kill(2)
    - rt_sigqueueinfo(2)
    The syscall is defined in such a way that it can also operate on thread fds
    instead of process fds. In a future patchset I will extend it to operate on
    taskfds from /proc/<pid>/task/<tid> at which point it will additionally
    take on the job of:
    - tgkill(2)
    - rt_tgsigqueueinfo(2)
    Right now this is intentionally left out to keep this patchset as simple as
    possible (cf. [4]). If a taskfd of /proc/<pid>/task/<tid> is passed
    EOPNOTSUPP will be returned to give userspace a way to detect when I add
    support for such taskfds (cf. [10]).

     Yes. So it would currently replace rt_gsigqueueinfo() but
     not rt_tgsigqueueinfo(), and could be extended to do both
     afterwards, without making the interface ugly in any form?
     
     I suppose we can always add more flags if needed, and you
     already ensure that flags is zero for the moment.

     "Is the current procfd_signal() proposal (under whichever name)
     sufficient to correctly implement both sys_rt_sigqueueinfo() and
     sys_rt_tgsigqueueinfo()?"

Florian was asking specifically in [5]:

     "Looking at the rt_tgsigqueueinfo interface, is there a way to implement
     the “tg” part with the current procfd_signal interface?"
