I realize that this is out of scope for linux-abi, but I *stongly*
disagree with this notion.  futex() needs to be just as stable as
anything else: old glibc versions must continue to work.  I just
jumped through a bunch of hoops to keep a single glibc patch release
in OpenSUSE 9 working in a maintainable way; breaking futex will break
far more than that.

Additionally, at least the FUTEX_WAIT and FUTEX_WAKE operations are
extremely useful, and they can do things that are tedious at best
using mutexes and condvars.  It's a simple API to use.  I use it, and
I've seen plenty of other open-source apps using the futex API
directly.

I think the best way forward might be to try to convince the glibc
maintainers to add the wrapper.
