Hi Jann,

Thanks for your further review. Follow-up of one point below.

Okay -- got it now, I think. I made this text:

        2.  If the access mode specifies PTRACE_MODE_FSCREDS, then, for
            the check in the next step, employ the caller's  filesystem
            UID  and  GID.  (As noted in credentials(7), the filesystem
            UID and GID almost always have the same values as the  cor=E2=
=80=90
            responding effective IDs.)

            Otherwise, the access mode specifies PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS,
            so use the caller's real UID and GID for the checks in  the
            next  step.  (Most APIs that check the caller's UID and GID
            use  the  effective  IDs.   For  historical  reasons,   the
            PTRACE_MODE_REALCREDS check uses the real IDs instead.)

[...]

Cheers,

Michael
