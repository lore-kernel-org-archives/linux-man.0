I think we can still improve :)

I've re-read the whole first paragraphs, and have a few comments that
touch upon this specific wording. Lets see. You have:

I've rephrased the next paragraph. How about adding this to follow?

       A futex is in essence a 32-bit user-space address. All futex ope=
rations and
       conditions are governed by this variable, from now on referred t=
o as 'futex
       word'. As such, a futex is identified by the address in shared m=
emory, which
       may or may not be shared between different processes. For virtua=
l memory, the
       kernel will internally handle and resolve the later. This futex =
word, along
       with the value at its the memory location, are supplied to the f=
utex() system
       call.

=46eel free to reword however you think is better.

Thanks,
Davidlohr
