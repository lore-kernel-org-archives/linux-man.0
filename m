I think if you just name it "net_cls cgroup" it should be good enough in case
the concern is that "network classifier" name would be misunderstood.

Point here should be that there's cgroups v1 and v2 infra. Both are available
and you can use a mixture of them, but net_cls is v1 only whereas bpf progs on
cgroups is v2 only feature. And if you look at struct sock_cgroup_data, it's
a union for the socket, so you can only use one of them with regards to sockets.

No, it's only for sch_clsact where we don't need to hold it. Take a look at
__dev_queue_xmit(), and where sch_handle_egress() is called. It's right before
the dev->priv_flags & IFF_XMIT_DST_RELEASE check where we either hold or drop
the dst from skb.

In cls_bpf_prog_from_efd() the tcf_block_netif_keep_dst() will handle this.
If you call cls_bpf e.g. out of htb via htb_classify() -> tcf_classify()
then you would have to hold it and thus call netif_keep_dst() so that the
test in __dev_queue_xmit() results in holding the dst via skb_dst_force().

Cheers,
Daniel
