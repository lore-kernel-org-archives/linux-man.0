Hi all,

This is the eighth revision of a patchset that adds to XFS kernel
support for mapping multiple file logical blocks to the same physical
block (reflink/deduplication), implements the beginnings of online
metadata scrubbing and preening, and implements reverse mapping for
the realtime device.  There shouldn't be any incompatible on-disk
format changes, pending a thorough review of the patches within.

The patches in this series fix some errors and clarify further the
behavior of the clone and dedupe ioctls.  The third patch is a RFC
manpage for the proposed GETFSMAP ioctl, though the interface is not
yet upstream.

This is an extraordinary way to eat your data.  Enjoy! 
Comments and questions are, as always, welcome.
