With in-kernel code?  Please let me know and I'll go fix it up to not
allow that, as that is not ok.

I do know of some bad examples of out-of-tree code abusing debugfs to do
crazy things (battery level monitoring?), but that's their own fault...

debugfs is for DEBUGGING!  For anything you all feel should be "secure",
then just disable it entirely.
