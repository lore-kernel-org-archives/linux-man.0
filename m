It sounds to me you are trying to tell way to much while actually being
a bit misleading. Even sub-range MAP_FIXED is not multi-thread safe.

Really the more corner cases you will try to cover the worse the end
result will end up. I would just try to be simple here and mention the
address space corruption issues you've had earlier and be done with it.
Maybe add a note that some architectures might need a special alignement
and fail if it is not the case but nothing really specific.
