The point is: userspace takes "task" to be a generic term for processes
and tasks. Which is what is important. The term also covers process
groups for all that its worth. Most of userspace isn't even aware of
that distinction necessarily.

fd_send_signal() makes the syscall name meaningless: what is userspace
signaling too? The point being that there's a lot more that you require
userspace to infer from fd_send_signal() than from task_send_signal()
where most people get the right idea right away: "signals to a process
or thread".

[1]: You cannot replicate certain aspects of kill *yet*. We have
established this before. If we want process group support later we do
have the flags argument to extend the sycall.

It's what glibc and Florian care about for pthreads and their our
biggest user atm so they get some I'd argue they get some say in this. :)
