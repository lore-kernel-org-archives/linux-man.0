I don't get the above. I mean, if we have the following hierarchy,
where R is the cgoup v2 mount point:

R---A(d)------B(d)
 \       \----C(d)
  \
   \
    X(d)------Y(d)

And we write "threaded" to A/cgroup.type, then we end up with:

R---A(t)------B(di)
 \       \----C(di)
  \
   \
    X(d)------Y(d)

(To be clear: "(d)" means "domain", "(di)" means "domain invalid", and
"(t)" means "threaded".)

But equally (in another world), that operation could have resulted in:

R---A(t)------B(t)
 \       \----C(t)
  \
   \
    X(d)------Y(d)

It's not clear to me how "Doing that for cgroups further down in the
hierarchy would be really inconsistent", since in the current
implementation, those same thread groups are converted to "domain
invalid" type.  What am I missing?

But, regarding the next point:

The "allowing for future" extensions idea makes some sense to me.

One other point that occurred to me after I wrote my email yesterday
was that if the threaded root reverts from being "domain threaded" to
"domain" (because it no longer has "threaded" children AND either it
has no member processes or it has no threaded controllers enabled),
then the "domain invalid" descendants revert to type "domain". I'm not
sure whether that detail also provides some rationale as to why all
descendants of the threaded root cgroup aren't automatically converted
to type "threaded". Any thoughts about that?

Thanks,

Michael
