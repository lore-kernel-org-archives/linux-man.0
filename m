Thanks very much! That all helped a bunch already! I'll try to go the
copy_siginfo_from_user64() way first and see if I can make this work. If
we do this I would however only want to use it for the new syscall first
and not change all other signal syscalls over to it too. I'd rather keep
this patchset focussed and small and do such conversions caused by the
new approach later. Does that sound reasonable?
