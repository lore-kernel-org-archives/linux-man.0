Sorry, this was more anecdotal, and probably more of a distraction than
constructive. I just meant that unlike other things which you can point to
a specific struct for (task, rt_mutex, etc.), a "futex" has it's state
distributed across the backing store (uaddr), the queue (futex_q), the
pi_state, the rt_mutex, etc, and these span kernel space and userspace.
Your description above is correct.

Based on your wording below about taking a user POV on this, I'm going to
say "yes" here. These opcodes paired with the PI futex value policy
(described below) defines a "futex" as PI aware. These were created very
specifically in support of PI pthread_mutexes, so it makes a lot more
sense to talk about a PI aware pthread_mutex, than a PI aware futex, since
there is a lot of policy and scaffolding that has to be built up around it
to use it properly (this is what a PI pthread_mutex is).

Hrm, tricky indeed. From userspace, what makes a "futex" PI is the policy
agreement between kernel and userspace (which is the value of the futex:
0, TID, TID|WAITERS, and never just WAITERS, and the use of PI aware futex
op codes when making the futex syscalls.

For a longer discussion of this policy, see Documentation/pi-futex.txt.
Also note that this policy can be combined with that for robust futexes,
adding the OWNERDIED component.
