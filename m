If you open /proc/pid, you get a file descriptor of type A. If you
pass that file descriptor to taskfd_signal, you signal the process. If
you open a file descriptor to /proc/pid/task/tid, you get a file
descriptor of type B, and if you pass that file descriptor to
taskfd_signal, you signal the thread. A and B are *already* distinct.
The only reason you'd want to require a flag for case B is to reduce
the probability of error. The flag wouldn't let you open /proc/pid,
yielding an A, and then pass it to taskfd_signal with a flag saying
"interpret as B".

I understand that it'd be inconsistent to later add a flag saying
"interpret this A as a reference to its whole process group", because
with respect to the difference between threads and processes, it's the
file descriptor type that controls the operation invoked, not the
flags. We can solve that by introducing a new FD type for a process
group or by just allowing the "casting" via flag, but we're not at the
point of having to decide that just yet, and I don't think the API is
particularly bad either way.

If you don't want to require a flag value when passing a B, then fine.
It'll work either with or without the flag. If, instead, you want the
flag to allow "casting" an A to a B or vice versa, that's fine too.

Sure.
