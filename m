'current' is the work queue item in this case, do we need to protect
against anything else? I can add the locking around the assignments
(both places).

I think we're deadling with the same thing as the files below, I'll
defer to that.

The anonfd is CLOEXEC. The idea is exactly that it only runs when the
last reference to the file has been dropped. Not sure why you think I
need ->flush() here?

Let me see if I can explain my intent better than that comment... We
know the parent who set up the io_uring instance will be around for as
long as io_uring instance persists. When we are tearing down the
io_uring, then we wait for any async contexts (like the one above) to
exit. Once they are exited, it's safe to proceed with the exit and
teardown ->files[].

That's the idea... Not trying to be clever, some of this dates back to
the aio weirdness where it was impossible to have cross references like
this, since it would lead to teardown deadlocks with how exit_aio() is
used. I can probably grab a struct files reference above, but currently
I don't see why it's needed.
