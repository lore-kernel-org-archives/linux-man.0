What I saw badly missing from your description is not the level of
detail but bring things into a form that ordinary mortals can
understand.

For an explanation to be clear I think we very much need the high level
overview first.  Then we can expand that description with the very
detailed view.

I very much think we need to describe things in such a way that people
understand the principles behind the permission checks, and not just
have the documentation echo the code, so that people can know what weird
things LSMs like yama are likely to do, and how these checks are likely
to evolve in the future.

Because one thing is clear to me.  The evolution of these details is
clearly not done, and will continue to change in the future.
