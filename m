The real benefit of doing it this way is that it allows applications to
add or remove write or access permissions independently of what the
previous permissions were.

For instance, I would expect code to be structured with pairs of
enable/disable operations, like:

int read_something(void)
{
	int ret;
	pkey_access_enable(pkey);
	ret = *some_pkey_memory; // Is this readable or writable?
	pkey_access_disable(pkey);
	return ret;
}

If we do what you suggest, we need to have the program keep extra state
about whether the 'some_pkey_memory' should be write-disabled once
access-enabled.  If we leave it as-is, we get the benefit of the
PKRU[].WD disable bit to do this for us.

In other words, if an application does a pkey_write_disable(), the app
can reasonably expect that *no* writes will be allowed until the app
does a pkey_write_enable().
