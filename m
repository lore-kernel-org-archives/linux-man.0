Why exactly does this fix it?  I guess that, if a supplementary group
is in your subgid list, then we can assume that dropping it is safe?

The main hoop I can think of is that setgroups would be impossible to
call if you have an unmapped supplementary group.  This could break
all kinds of things.

Bugs definitely exist, but I have this erie feeling that the bugs may be in instances of userspace using this negative group permission pattern.  I think we may have a hideous case of one setuid binary defeating a privilege check of another piece of code.

Agreed.
