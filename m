What's the use case you envision for that? I don't see how that would be
better than using SHMLBA, which is available at compiler time. Because 
unless someone expects to be able to run an app that was compiled for 
Arch X, on Arch Y (surely that's not requirement here?), I don't see how
the run-time check is any better.

Or maybe you're thinking that since the SHMLBA cannot be put in the man
pages, we could instead provide MapAlignment as sort of a different
way to document the requirement?
