Agreed.

POSIX.1-2001 actually specifies getgroups, but not setgroups.  In any
case, yes, POSIX doesn't say anything about this behavior.

Ignored it and kept going, starting the user's shell as root?

I'd guess that a similar story motivated the note in the Linux manpages
for setuid, setresuid, and similar, saying "Note: there are cases where
setuid() can fail even when the caller is UID 0; it is a grave security
error to omit checking for a failure return from setuid().".

(Also, these days, glibc marks setuid and similar with the
warn_unused_result attribute.)

An option sounds sensible to me.  I think a sysctl makes more sense,
though.  I'll add one in v4.

What did you have in mind about the shell script? Something like:
grep -r !% /etc/sudoers /etc/sudoers.d
?
