If everyone else is okay with it, I can get on board with three
variants on x86.  What I can't get on board with is *five* variants on
x86, which would be:

procfd_signal via int80 / the 32-bit vDSO: the ia32 structure

syscall64 with nr == 335 (presumably): 64-bit

syscall64 with nr == 548 | 0x40000000: x32

syscall64 with nr == 548: 64-bit entry but in_compat_syscall() ==
true, behavior is arbitrary

syscall64 with nr == 335 | 0x40000000: x32 entry, but
in_compat_syscall() == false, behavior is arbitrary

This mess isn't really Christian's fault -- it's been there for a
while, but it's awful and I don't think we want to perpetuate it.

Obviously, I'd prefer a variant where the structure that's passed in
is always the same.

BTW, do we consider siginfo_t to be extensible?  If so, and if we pass
in a pointer, presumably we should pass a length as well.
