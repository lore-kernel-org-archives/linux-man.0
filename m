Deepa has recently reworked the handling for the sigset_t handling
to be more consistent. As I understand it, we only ever check the
size argument to ensure that user and kernel space agree on
the size, as it there had been some historic differences.

If you pass a signal mask to a syscall, you should now just use the
set_user_sigmask()/set_compat_user_sigmask()/restore_user_sigmask()
helpers. The compat version is required for the incompatible bit order
between 32-bit and 64-bit big-endian architectures (on little-endian, compa=
t
and native signal masks are compatible), and to deal with the one
architecture that has an _NSIG defined to something other than 64:
MIPS uses 128 because of a historic accident.

I think Deepa originally suggested combining set_user_sigmask()
and set_compat_user_sigmask(), using an in_compat_syscall()
check. This would let us simplify a number of compat syscalls
(ppoll, ppoll_time32, pselect6, pselect6_time32, epoll_pwait()
io_pgetevents_time64, io_pgetevents_time32). I advised against
changing it at the time for consistency with other compat syscalls,
but it's something we can still do now.

There was a recent discussion about the size of sigset_t in glibc,
which is 1024 bits there instead of 64 bits in the kernel, the idea
being that the kernel might eventually grow more signals at
some point in the future, as we did when we extended from 32
to 64 a long time ago with the addition of the rt_sig* signals;
