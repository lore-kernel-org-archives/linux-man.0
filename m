Yup, I recently added that as well, based on a patch from Jan Chaloupka=

So, how about this text:

              After a successful MADV_DONTNEED operation, the seman=E2=80=
=90
              tics  of  memory  access  in  the specified region are
              changed: subsequent accesses of  pages  in  the  range
              will  succeed,  but will result in either reloading of
              the memory contents from the  underlying  mapped  file
              (for  shared file mappings, shared anonymous mappings,
              and shmem-based techniques such  as  System  V  shared
              memory  segments)  or  zero-fill-on-demand  pages  for
              anonymous private mappings.

Thanks,

Michael
