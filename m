That was clear all along and was pointed at every occassion in the
threads. I even went through the hazzle to give you all of the
references when there's lore.kernel.org.

I'm sorry I don't understand what you a) mean with this sentence "width
of the target" and b) what you *exactly* want from us to get this accepted.

That's why this system call is exactly kept as simple as it is. Which I
had to fight for! You kept consistenly asking for features such as:
- add a pid parameter maybe
- allow to signal into ancestor and cousin pid namespaces
I fought all of those off for the sake of keeping this patch as simple
as possible so that we can get it in.
We don't even need to decide whether we go for flags or another type of
fd right now. The point was that we can postpone this to a later
discussion. Which also has been discussed in multiple threads. That's
literally what I wrote in prior mails and nearly everyone agreed that
this is a good strategy.

I honestly have no idea what to make of your review given that it
started from a naming issue and suddenly the whole api is crap.
If you want this to be named fd_send_signal() to get in. Then seriously,
I'm happy to rename it. I honestly don't care even though I think taskfd
is a better name.
