I had a closer look and I now think that's not the case.  These
instructions work fine even if the function is not inlined.  See more
below.

This seems to be the original reason for the optimisation requirement.
The manual says [0]:

  GCC does not inline any functions when not optimizing unless you
  specify the =E2=80=98always_inline=E2=80=99 attribute for the function [.=
..]

  [...]

  If you specify both inline and extern in the function definition, then
  the definition is used only for inlining.  In no case is the function
  compiled on its own, not even if you refer to its address explicitly.
  Such an address becomes an external reference, as if you had only
  declared the function, and had not defined it.

  This combination of inline and extern has almost the effect of a
  macro. [...]

  0: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Inline.html

Thus, using "extern inline" but not enabling optimisations (and not
providing a separate definition in some other object) would have
produced a linker error.

That "__inline" keyword (yes, it's a keyword, regardless of eponymous
macros) is odd.  Apparently an old non-standard import from MSVC.

Are standard/newer keywords (inline/__inline__) not used for reasons of
backward compatibility (with old compiler or C language versions)?
