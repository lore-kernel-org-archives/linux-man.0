So what *should* happen in that case? A panic? Come on. There's
nothing wrong with returning an error pending an expansion of
capabilities later.

Huh?

Your review makes no sense and comes off as an increasingly nitpicky
strategy of blocking the change no matter what Christian does. On
several occasions, you've just said "no, I don't like this" without
constructively trying to suggest an alternative that allows us to make
progress. That's obstruction, and this patch should get into the tree
over your nack.

There are no maintenance issues. Christian has bent over backwards
trying to address all the code concerns raised in this thread, and
nothing has been good enough.

What bugs? You have identified no bugs. There is no problem with the
API signature. It signals a task. You get that from proc.
