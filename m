The man page now corresponds.

AFAICS, just set lookup_flags to include LOOKUP_EMPTY and
getname_flags() does the rest. (Essentially, AT_EMPTY_PATH is a safety
catch for an empty path: if the path is nonempty, it is interpreted as
usual, othewise if it is empty, you get ENOENT unless AT_EMPTY_PATH is
also set.

I took the second approach.

Two points:
* You do realize the text about "dummy values" was your original text?
* Adding "and cleared otherwise" to end of the paragraph doesn't make
sense. I'll leave the text as is, but if you want to propose a more
complete phrasing, let me know.

Already done.

To what does "it" refer?

Anyway, I think we do need some better text describing these two
fields and the difference between them. Can you come up with
something?

Cheers,
