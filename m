The point is that if you are in an error state, the error state does not
go away, *especially* if you do not expect the process to terminate and
have not arranged for something calling waitpid on the PID.

They cannot do this reliably because the error state is not persistent:
the PID can be reused.  So for the legacy interface, a difference in
error signaling would just have encouraged a bad programming model.

I don't think so.  My point is that the FD-based mechanism finally
allows to cope with this in a reasonable way.

I can live with that.
