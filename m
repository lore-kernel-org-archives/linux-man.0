Especially with poll support now in the series, don't we need a ѕigmask
argument similar to pselect/ppoll/io_pgetevents now to deal with signal
blocking during waiting for events?

Can you make sure all the structs use tab indentation for their
field names?  Maybe even the same for all structs just to be nice
to my eyes?

I think we can just check in_compat_syscall() here, which means we
can kill the ->compat member, and the separate compat version of the
setup syscall.

Can you explain why not taking the completion lock is safe here?  And
why we want to have such a somewhat dangerous special case just for the
no-op benchmarking aid?

Do we really need to optimize the sq_head == tail case so much? Or
am I missing why we are using the cached sq head case here?  Maybe
add some more comments for a start.

Why do we have this special case?  Does it need some documentation?

Maybe using different names and slightly different semantics for the
return values would clear some of this up?

	if (to_submit) {
		submitted = io_ring_submit(ctx, to_submit);
		if (submitted < 0)
			return submitted;
	}
	if (flags & IORING_ENTER_GETEVENTS) {
		...
		ret = io_cqring_wait(ctx, min_complete);
	}

	return submitted ? submitted : ret;

Can we just merge these two functions into the callers?  Currently
the flow is a little odd with these helpers that don't seem to be
too clear about their responsibilities.

Why is this using the page_frag helpers?  Also the callers just free
these ctx structure, so there isn't much of a point zeroing them out.

Also I'd be tempted to open code the freeing in io_allocate_scq_urings
instead of caling the helper, which would avoid the NULL checks and
make the error handling code a little more obvious.

do we even need the separate __io_uring_enter helper?

Do we really need this as a separate helper?
