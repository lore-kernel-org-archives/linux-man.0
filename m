Just so that I understand you correctly: swapping out struct signinfo
for struct signalfd_siginfo in procfd_<whatever-suffix>? If so that
sounds great to me!

Sounds good but is unrelated to this patchset I take it. :)

Yes, I see no reason why not. My idea is to extend it - after we have a
basic version in - to also work with:
/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>
If I'm not mistaken this should be sufficient to get rt_tgsigqueueinfo.
The thread will be uniquely identified by the tid descriptor and no
combination of /proc/<pid> and /proc/<pid>/task/<tid> is needed. Does
that sound reasonable?

All sounds reasonable to me but that's not a blocker for the current
syscall though, is it?
