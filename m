There is one big reason to have the check, and I have not seen it
mentioned yet in this thread.

When SI_USER is set we report the pid of the sender of the signal in
si_pid.  When the signal comes from the kernel si_pid == 0.  When signal
is sent from an ancestor pid namespace si_pid also equals 0 (which is
reasonable).

A signal out to a process in a parent pid namespace such as SIGCHLD is
reasonable as we can map the pid.  I really don't see the point of
forbidding that.  From the perspective of the process in the parent pid
namespace it is just another process in it's pid namespace.  So it
should pose no problem from the perspective of the receiving process.

A signal to a process in a pid namespace that is neither a parent nor a
descendent pid namespace would be a problem, as there is no well defined
notion of what si_pid should be set to.  So for that case perhaps we
should have something like a noprocess pid that we can set.  Perhaps we
could set si_pid to 0xffffffff.  That would take a small extension to
pid_nr_ns.

File descriptors are not namespaced.  It is completely legitimate to use
file descriptors to get around limitations of namespaces.

Adding limitations to a file descriptor based api because someone else
can't set up their processes in such a way as to get the restrictions
they are looking for seems very sad.

Frankly I think it is one of the better features of namespaces that we
have to carefully handle and define these cases so that when the
inevitable leaks happen you are not immediately in a world of hurt.  All
of the other permission checks etc continue to do their job.  Plus you
are prepared for the case when someone wants their containers to have an
interesting communication primitive.
