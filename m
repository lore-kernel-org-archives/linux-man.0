No.  The object being named by struct pid is an identifier.

The same identifier can label processes, the same identifier can
label threads, the same identifier can label process groups the
same identifier can label sessions.

That is fundamental to how that identifier works.

Now the new file descriptor can either be a handle to the struct pid
the general purpose identifier, or the file descriptor can be a handle
to a process.  Other file descriptor types would be handles to different
kinds of processes.


When people tell me the new interface can handle process groups or
sessions by just adding a flag.  I hear they want to have an handle
to struct pid then general purpose identifier.  Because it doesn't make
any sense at all to add a flag to when you need to add a new file
descriptor type to keep the API consistent.

Later when I hear people say that they want an identifier for a process
and not have a handle to a general purpose identifier I think they need
to think about differnt types of file descriptors for the different
purposes.  The flags argument does not help at all there.

There is a special case in kill(2) where we treat an identifier that
only identifies a thread as an identifier of a process.  We should
not copy that.

Making kill(2) only accept the pid of thread group leaders would make
all kinds of sense.  Unfortunately we need to stay bug compatible with
past versions of linux.  So kill(2) won't be changing unless it appears
clear that not a single application cares about that case.

I will eventually be changing kill(2) to not sending signals through
zombie group leaders so the permission checks are performed correctly.

All I am asking is that we don't copy that bug compatibility code into a
new system call, and that use use the current internal APIs in a fashion
that shows you are not replicating misfeatures of old system calls.

I know it takes understanding a little more kernel code but for people
designing a signal sending API it is not unreasonable to ask that they
understand the current APIs and the current code.  The fact that this
discussion has revealed some significant misconceptions of how the
current code works, and what I am asking for concerns me.
