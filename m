Would be more precise IMO because reload might be interpreted as a major
fault which is not necessarily the case (see below).

Yes, this wording is better because many users are not aware of
MAP_ANON|MAP_SHARED being file backed in fact and mmap man page doesn't
mention that.

I am just wondering whether it makes sense to mention that MADV_DONTNEED
for shared mappings might be surprising and not freeing the backing
pages thus not really freeing memory until there is a memory
pressure. But maybe this is too implementation specific for a man
page. What about the following wording on top of yours?
"
Please note that the MADV_DONTNEED hint on shared mappings might not
lead to immediate freeing of pages in the range. The kernel is free to
delay this until an appropriate moment. RSS of the calling process will
be reduced however.
