Ok, got it. If it turns out that we do need the timeout argument after all,
you could avoid one indirection level by grouping the sigset_t with
min_complete, timeout_ns and/or sigset_size, as long as the
sigset_t comes last (similar to struct sigaction).

Another (also awkward) trick might be to combine min_complete and
sigset_size into a 32-bit integer argument, as each of them can
fit into 16 bits.
