Right. But why *would* a container runtime send one of these procfs

If parent namespace procfs FDs or mounts really can leak into child
namespaces as easily as Aleksa says, then I don't mind adding the
check. I was under the impression that if you find yourself in this
situation, you already have a big problem.
