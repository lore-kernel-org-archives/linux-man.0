Yup, units need to be either in disk addresses (i.e. 512 byte units)
or bytes. If people can't handle disk addresses (seems to be the
case), the bytes it should be.

This is diagnositc information as much as anything, just like
fiemap is diagnostic information. So if we have specific type
information, it needs to be reported accurately to be useful.

Hence I really don't care if the users and developers of other fs
types don't understand what the special owner codes that a specific
filesystem returns mean. i.e. it's not useful user information -
only a tool that groks the specific filesystem is going to be able
to anything useful with special owner codes. So, IMO, there's little
point trying to make them generic or to even trying to define and
explain them in the man page....

Yup, that's what I initially noticed when I glanced at this. The XFS
getbmap interface is just plain nasty, and we shouldn't be copying
that API pattern if we can help it.

That's pretty much the structure I was going to suggest - it matches
the fiemap pattern. i.e control parameters are separated from record
data. I'd dump a bit more reserved space in the structure, though;
we've got heaps of flag space for future expansion, but if we need
to pass new parameters into/out of the kernel we'll quickly use the
reserved space.

Cheers,

Dave.
