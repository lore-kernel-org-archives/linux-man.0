Michael, thanks again for the detailed review.  I've tried to respond to
all your comments.  Here's an incremental patch from the last one.  I'll
also resend the entire thing shortly.

Just a few questions to clarify some of your review comments below...

I'm not seeing that actually affect the formatting in the resulting
manpage as I view it.  Is that really the syntax you want?  Is there
another example bit of syntax I should be looking for?

I did reword some things in response to this review comment, but not
thoroughly enough. :)

How about the following as a change to the existing second paragraph?

The effects of a call to
.BR pkey_set ()
from a signal handler will not persist when the signal handler
returns.  This is true whether the return is to a normal,
non-signal context, or to another signal handler.

I've added the following text:

Any application wanting to use protection keys needs to be able
to function without them.  They might be unavailable because the
hardware the application runs on does not support them, the
kernel code does not contain support, the kernel support has been
disabled, or because the keys have all been allocated, perhaps by
a library the application is using.  It is recommended that
applications wanting to use protection keys should simply call
.BR pkey_alloc()
instead of attempting to detect support for the
feature in any other way.

Hardware support for protection keys may be enumerated with
the cpuid instruction.  Details on how to do this can be
found in the Intel Software Developers Manual.  The kernel
performs this enumeration and exposes the information in
/proc/cpuinfo under the "flags" field.  "pku" in this field
indicates hardware support for protection keys and "ospke"
indicates that the kernel contains and has enabled protection
keys support,.

Sure, I'll include one in pkey(7).
