Whilst I don't think this is the correct solution, I agree that there's
a potential issue here. We could change the restart return value to
-ERESTARTNOINTR instead, but I can imagine something like a periodic
SIGALRM which could prevent a large cacheflush from ever completing.
Do we actually care about making forward progress in such a scenario?

It is interesting to note that this change has been in mainline since
May last year without any reported issues. That could be down to a number
of reasons:

  (1) People are using old kernels on ARM

  (2) Code doesn't check the return value from the cacheflush system call,
      because it historically always returned 0

  (3) People are getting lucky with timing, as this is likely difficult
      to hit

Related to (2) is that a `man cacheflush' invocation returns something
about the MIPs system call, that doesn't match what we do for ARM. The
(relatively recent) history of the system call on ARM is:

  < v3.5 [*]

    - Always returns 0
    - Restricts virtual address range to a single VMA
    - Page-aligns the region limits (over flushing for smaller ranges)
    - Terminates on the first fault
    - Flags are ignored but must "ALWAYS be passed as ZERO"

  v3.5 - v3.12
    - Returns -EINVAL if flags is set or if end < start
    - Returns -EINVAL if we couldn't find a vma
    - Terminates on the first fault and returns -EFAULT

  v3.12 - HEAD

    - No longer page-aligns region
    - Removes VMA checking as this had a deadlock bug with mmap_sem
      and we could handle faults by this point anyway
    - Returns -EINVAL if !access_ok for the range
    - Splits the range into PAGE_SIZE chunks, checking for reschedule
      and pending signals to avoid DoSing the system (the hardware can
      only clean by cacheline). This is where the -ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK
      behaviour came in, potentially returning -EINTR to userspace.

This leaves me with the following questions:

  - Has this change been shown to break anything in practice?
  - Can we change the internal return value to -ERESTARTNOINTR?
  - What do we do about kernels that *do* return -EINTR? (>=3.12?)
  - Can we get a manpage put together to describe this mess?

Cheers,

Will
