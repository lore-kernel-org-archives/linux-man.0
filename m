OK, that does make sense. I've added the locking.

That would obviously be a problem...

If that's the case, then the mm/files referencing needs to be looked
over for sure. It's currently relying on the fact that the parent stays
alive. If it can go away without ->release() being called, then we have
issues.

Of course, I do realize that.

Yes, only on ->relase().
