Why would you use 512-byte sectors in a new interface?  I recall for =
FIEMAP
that some filesystems may not have files aligned to sector offsets, and =
we
just used byte offsets.  Storage like NVDIMMs are cacheline granular, so =
I
don't think it makes sense to tie this to old disk sector sizes.  =
Alternately,
the units could be in terms of fs blocks as returned by =
statvfs.st_bsize,
but mixing units for fmv_block, fmv_offset, fmv_length is uneeded =
complexity.

These above ones are relatively clear what they are.  The next items are
not very clear what they are, and whether they need to be exported as
specific items, or could they just be lumped under "FMV_OWN_FS"?  If =
they
serve some specific purpose, at a minimum they need better descriptions.

It seems like there are several fields in the structure that are used =
for
only input or only output?  Does it make more sense to have one =
structure
used only for the input request, and then the array of values returned =
be
in a different structure?  I'm not necessarily requesting that it be =
changed,
but it definitely is something I noticed a few times while reading this =
doc.

Cheers, Andreas
