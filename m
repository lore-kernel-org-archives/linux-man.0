Upon Peter's request the core will does some initial parsing but the
PMU drivers are responsible to parse the "cfg" and "option" parts in
order to validate their content.

SysFS is very constraining - I think it would be much better in the
PMU's documentation under Documentation/.  I have a patch ready for
that.

I agree.

Using an ioctl() seemed to be the best approach since all the
infrastructure is already there.  Also different drivers may need to
see configuration options updated - it is simply not the case for
CoreSight.

By the way, my next patchset will make PERF_DRV_CONFIG_MAX visible to
user space.
